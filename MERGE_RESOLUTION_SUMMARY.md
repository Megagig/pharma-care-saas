# Merge Resolution Summary: develop → main

## Status: ✅ SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED

All merge conflicts have been resolved without any data loss. Your main branch now includes all features from develop.

## Conflicts Resolved

### 1. Source File Conflict
**File:** `frontend/src/services/clinicalInterventionService.ts`

**Issue:** API endpoint paths differed between branches
- main branch: `/clinical-interventions/analytics/summary`
- develop branch: `/api/clinical-interventions/analytics/summary` ✓ (correct)

**Resolution:** Kept develop's version with `/api/` prefix (correct path)

**Changes:**
- Line 327: Fixed dashboard metrics endpoint
- Line 365: Fixed outcome report endpoint  
- Line 383: Standardized filter condition to `String(value) !== ''`

### 2. Build/Dist Files
**Files:**
- `backend/dist/app.d.ts.map`
- `backend/dist/app.js.map`
- `frontend/build/index.html`
