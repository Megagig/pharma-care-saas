uploadAttachment(noteId: string, files: File[]): Promise<{
  message: string;
  attachments: Attachment[];
  note: ClinicalNote;
}>

// Delete attachment from note
deleteAttachment(noteId: string, attachmentId: string): Promise<{
  message: string;
  note: ClinicalNote;
}>

#### Form Enhancement:

```typescript
// Added new section to form
{ id: 'attachments', title: 'Attachments', expanded: false }

// Enhanced form submission to handle file uploads
const onSubmit = async (data: ClinicalNoteFormData) => {
  // ... existing logic

  // Upload attachments for new notes
  if (result.note && attachments.length > 0) {
    const filesToUpload = attachments
      .filter(att => att.file && att.uploadStatus === 'pending')
      .map(att => att.file!);

    if (filesToUpload.length > 0) {
      await clinicalNoteService.uploadAttachment(result.note._id, filesToUpload);
    }
  }
}
```

### 5. User Interface Enhancements

#### Visual Features:

- **Card-based Layout**: Modern card layout for attachment display
- **File Type Icons**: Appropriate icons for different file types
- **Preview Functionality**:
   - Image thumbnails with click-to-enlarge
   - PDF preview in modal
   - File information display
- **Progress Indicators**: Upload progress with percentage
- **Status Indicators**: Upload status chips (pending, uploading, completed, error)

#### User Experience:

- **Drag-and-Drop Zone**: Visual feedback for drag operations
- **Confirmation Dialogs**: Delete confirmation to prevent accidental deletion
- **Error Messages**: Clear, actionable error messages
- **Success Feedback**: Snackbar notifications for successful operations
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices

### 6. Testing Implementation

**Files**:

- `frontend/src/components/__tests__/NoteFileUpload.basic.test.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/__tests__/NoteFileUpload.enhanced.test.tsx`

#### Test Coverage:

- **Basic Functionality**: Upload area rendering, file type validation
- **File Operations**: Upload, download, delete operations
- **Error Handling**: File size limits, type validation, network errors
