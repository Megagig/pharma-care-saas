# 🚀 Safe Git Workflow Guide

## For New Features (RECOMMENDED APPROACH):

### 1. Always start from clean develop
```bash
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop  # Get latest changes
```

### 2. Create feature branch with descriptive name
```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# Examples:
# git checkout -b feature/patient-search-enhancement
# git checkout -b feature/medication-alerts
# git checkout -b bugfix/login-validation
```

### 3. Work on your feature
```bash
# Make your changes
git add .
git commit -m "Descriptive commit message"
```

### 4. Regular backups (IMPORTANT!)
```bash
# Create backup before major changes
git branch backup-$(date +%Y%m%d)-your-feature-name
```

### 5. Push feature branch regularly
```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

### 6. When ready, create Pull Request
- Go to GitHub
- Create PR from feature branch to develop
- Get code review
- Merge via GitHub (not locally)

## 🛡️ Data Protection Rules:

### ALWAYS:
✅ Create backup branches before major changes
✅ Push feature branches to remote regularly  
✅ Use descriptive branch names
✅ Commit frequently with clear messages
✅ Test locally before pushing

### NEVER:
❌ Work directly on develop/main
❌ Force push without --force-with-lease
❌ Delete branches without backups
❌ Merge large conflicts without understanding them
❌ Work on multiple features in same branch

## 🔧 Emergency Recovery Commands:

### If you mess up:
```bash
# See all branches (including backups)
git branch -a

# Restore from backup
git checkout backup-YYYYMMDD-feature-name
git checkout -b feature/recovered-work

# Check what changed
git log --oneline -10
git diff HEAD~1
```

### If you need to start over:
```bash
# Reset to clean develop
git checkout develop
git reset --hard origin/develop
git clean -fd
```
