# 🔧 Restart Backend - License Approval Fixed!

## ✅ Fix Applied!

The `approveLicense` and `rejectLicense` methods were trying to use a non-existent "License" model. Fixed to use the User model directly.

## 🚀 Restart Backend NOW:

### Step 1: Stop Backend
In your backend terminal, press `Ctrl+C`

### Step 2: Restart Backend
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Step 3: Test Approval
1. Login as super admin
2. Go to SaaS Settings → License Verification
3. See Megagig Solution's pending license
4. Click "Approve"
5. **Should work now!** ✅

## ✅ What Was Fixed:

**Before (Broken):**
```typescript
const License = mongoose.model('License'); // ❌ Model doesn't exist
const license = await License.findOne({ userId, status: 'pending' });
```

**After (Fixed):**
```typescript
const user = await User.findById(userId); // ✅ Use User model
user.licenseStatus = 'approved';
user.licenseVerifiedAt = new Date();
user.licenseVerifiedBy = req.user!._id;
user.status = 'active';
await user.save();
```

## 📋 Complete Flow After Restart:

1. **Admin approves license**
   - License status changes to "approved"
   - User status changes to "active"
   - User receives approval email
   - License removed from pending list

2. **User logs in**
   - Can access Clinical Notes ✅
   - Can access MTR ✅
   - Can access Clinical Interventions ✅
   - Can access AI Diagnostics ✅
   - Can access Clinical Decision Support ✅

**Just restart backend and test!** 🚀
