## ✅ Testing Checklist

Before going live, test:
- [ ] License upload with all fields
- [ ] File validation (type and size)
- [ ] License number uniqueness check
- [ ] Protected route access without license
- [ ] Protected route access with pending license

## 📧 Email Notifications

The system sends emails for:

3. **User Approval** - Congratulations when license is approved
4. **User Rejection** - Notification with reason when license is rejected

## 🔧 Configuration Required

### Environment Variables:
```env
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
EMAIL_SERVICE_API_KEY=your_email_service_key
UPLOAD_MAX_SIZE=5242880
```

### Server Configuration:
- Ensure file upload limits are set correctly
- Verify email service credentials
- Check file storage permissions

## 📝 What You Need to Do

### Immediate Actions:
1. ✅ Review all code changes
