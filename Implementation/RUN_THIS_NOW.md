# ðŸš€ ACTIVATE YOUR SUBSCRIPTION NOW

## The Issue
The Subscription model uses `workspaceId` but the scripts were looking for `userId`. This has been fixed!

## Run This Command

```bash
cd backend
npm run activate-subscription megagigsolution@example.com
```

## What This Will Do

1. Find your user by email
2. Get your `workplaceId` from your user record
3. Find or create a subscription using the correct `workspaceId`
4. Link it to your Pro plan payment
5. Activate everything properly

## After Running

1. Restart your backend server
2. Refresh your frontend
3. You should have full Pro access!

## If You Get "No workplaceId" Error

This means your user account isn't linked to a workplace yet. You'll need to:
1. Create a workplace in the app, OR
2. Join an existing workplace

Then run the activation script again.
