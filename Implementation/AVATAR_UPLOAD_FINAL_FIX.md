# 🎯 Avatar Upload - FINAL FIX Applied

## The Real Problem

The error `SyntaxError: Unexpected token '<', "<!doctype "... is not valid JSON` was happening because:

1. After uploading the avatar, the code called `queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ['user', 'profile'] })`
2. This **triggered a refetch** of the `['user', 'profile']` query
3. The refetch was trying to call an endpoint that either:
   - Didn't exist (404 → HTML error page)
   - Required authentication that wasn't being sent (401 → HTML error page)
4. The HTML error page was being parsed as JSON → causing the error

## The Solution: Stop Using `invalidateQueries()`

Instead of invalidating the query (which triggers a refetch), we **update the cache directly** using `setQueryData()`.

### ❌ Before (WRONG):
```typescript
onSuccess: (avatarUrl) => {
    queryClient.setQueryData(userSettingsKeys.profile, ...);
    queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ['user', 'profile'] }); // ← Causes refetch!
}
```

### ✅ After (CORRECT):
```typescript
onSuccess: (avatarUrl) => {
    // Update both caches directly - no refetch needed!
    queryClient.setQueryData(userSettingsKeys.profile, (old) => {
        if (old) return { ...old, avatar: avatarUrl };
        return old;
    });
    queryClient.setQueryData(['user', 'profile'], (old) => {
        if (old) return { ...old, avatar: avatarUrl };
        return old;
    });
    toast.success('Profile picture uploaded successfully');
}
```

## Files Changed

### 1. `frontend/src/queries/userSettingsQueries.ts`
- **Line 58**: Replaced `invalidateQueries()` with `setQueryData()` in `useUploadAvatar`
- **Line 35**: Replaced `invalidateQueries()` with `setQueryData()` in `useUpdateUserProfile`

### 2. `frontend/src/lib/queryClient.ts`
- Added `credentials: 'include'` to `fetchUserProfile()` method
- Fixed endpoint to `/api/user/settings/profile`

### 3. `frontend/src/components/settings/ProfileTab.tsx`
- Added `getAvatarUrl()` helper function
- Updated Avatar component to use full URL in development mode

## Why This Works

When you upload an avatar:
1. Backend returns the new avatar URL
2. You **already have** the data you need (the avatar URL)
3. No need to refetch from server - just update the cache
4. No refetch = no error = avatar displays immediately ✨

This is called **"optimistic cache updates"** and is a React Query best practice.

## Testing Instructions

1. Open Settings page
2. Click camera icon on avatar
3. Select an image file (JPEG, PNG, GIF, or WebP, max 5MB)
4. ✅ Toast: "Profile picture uploaded successfully"
5. ✅ Image displays immediately
6. ✅ **NO console errors**
7. ✅ Refresh page - avatar persists

## Expected Behavior

- ✅ Upload works instantly
- ✅ Image displays immediately
- ✅ No console errors
- ✅ No refetch requests
- ✅ Works in both dev and production

## If You Still See Errors

1. **Clear browser cache and reload**
2. **Restart frontend dev server**: `npm run dev` in frontend folder
3. Make sure backend is running on port 5000
4. Check browser console for any other errors
5. Verify you're logged in with valid authentication
