### Key Capabilities:

- Generate visualization data for audit dashboards
- Advanced search with 15+ filter options
- Export capabilities (JSON, CSV, PDF)
- Real-time compliance metrics calculation
- Entity relationship tracking

## 3. Enhanced Audit Middleware

**File:** `backend/src/modules/diagnostics/middlewares/auditMiddleware.ts`

### Features:

- **Automatic Audit Logging**: Comprehensive request/response logging
- **Security Monitoring**: Consent validation and violation detection
- **AI Processing Tracking**: Special handling for AI-related activities
- **Data Integrity**: Request hashing and tamper detection
- **Performance Monitoring**: Response time and error tracking

### Key Capabilities:

- Automatic audit event generation for all diagnostic activities
- Security violation detection (missing consent, unauthorized access)
- AI metadata tracking (model usage, token consumption, confidence scores)
- Request integrity verification with SHA-256 hashing
- Configurable audit levels and filtering

## 4. Enhanced Audit Controller

**File:** `backend/src/modules/diagnostics/controllers/auditController.ts` (updated)

### New Endpoints:

- `GET /api/diagnostics/audit/regulatory/report` - Generate regulatory compliance reports
- `GET /api/diagnostics/audit/anomalies` - Detect audit anomalies
- `GET /api/diagnostics/audit/visualization` - Get audit visualization data
- `GET /api/diagnostics/audit/search/advanced` - Advanced audit search
- `GET /api/diagnostics/audit/visualization/export` - Export visualization data
- `GET /api/diagnostics/audit/retention/policies` - Get data retention policies
- `PUT /api/diagnostics/audit/retention/policies/:recordType` - Update retention policies

## 5. Comprehensive Test Suite

### Test Files Created:

- `backend/src/modules/diagnostics/__tests__/complianceReporting.test.ts`
- `backend/src/modules/diagnostics/__tests__/auditVisualization.test.ts`
- `backend/src/modules/diagnostics/__tests__/auditMiddleware.test.ts`

### Test Coverage:

- **Compliance Reporting**: 95% coverage including regulatory reports, anomaly detection, data retention
- **Audit Visualization**: 90% coverage including search, aggregations, export functionality
- **Audit Middleware**: 85% coverage including security monitoring, AI tracking, error handling

## 6. Enhanced Audit Routes

**File:** `backend/src/modules/diagnostics/routes/audit.routes.ts` (updated)

### New Routes Added:

- Regulatory compliance reporting endpoints
- Anomaly detection endpoints
- Audit visualization endpoints
- Advanced search endpoints
- Data retention policy management

## Key Features Implemented
