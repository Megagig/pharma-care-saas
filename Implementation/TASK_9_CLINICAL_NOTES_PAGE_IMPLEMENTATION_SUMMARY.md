- **Modified** all create note buttons to use callbacks when provided
- **Updated** view and edit actions to use callbacks
- **Maintained** backward compatibility with existing modal-based workflow

**Enhanced Props Interface:**

```typescript
interface ClinicalNotesDashboardProps {
  patientId?: string;
  embedded?: boolean;
  maxHeight?: number;
  onNoteSelect?: (noteId: string) => void;
  onNoteEdit?: (noteId: string) => void;
  onNoteCreate?: () => void;
}
```

### 4. Improved App.tsx Routing Structure

- **Updated** route imports to use new page components
- **Replaced** component routes with dedicated page routes
- **Maintained** existing route protection and feature flags
- **Ensured** proper AppLayout integration
