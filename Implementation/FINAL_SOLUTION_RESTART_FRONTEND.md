# ðŸŽ¯ FINAL SOLUTION - Restart Frontend Required

## The Real Problem
Cookies set by `http://127.0.0.1:5000` cannot be read by `http://127.0.0.1:5173` - they're different origins! This is browser security.

## The Solution
Use the **Vite proxy** so all requests go through the same origin (`http://127.0.0.1:5173`), which then proxies to the backend. This way cookies work because everything appears to be from the same origin.

## What I Just Fixed
Reverted ALL services back to using `/api` (Vite proxy) instead of direct backend URLs:
- âœ… authService
- âœ… apiClient  
- âœ… api.ts
- âœ… patientService
- âœ… drugInfoApi
- âœ… paymentService
- âœ… clinicalInterventionService
- âœ… subscriptionService
- âœ… featureFlagService
- âœ… fetchWrapper

## NOW YOU MUST RESTART FRONTEND

The Vite proxy configuration needs to be active for this to work.

### Step 1: Stop Frontend
Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal running the frontend

### Step 2: Start Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

### Step 3: Test the Proxy
Open a new terminal:
```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5173/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@test.com","password":"test"}'
```

You should get a JSON response (not 404)!

### Step 4: Login in Browser
1. Go to http://127.0.0.1:5173
2. Login
3. Check DevTools > Application > Cookies > `http://127.0.0.1:5173`
4. You should see `accessToken` and `refreshToken` cookies!

## Why This Works Now

**Before:**
- Frontend at `127.0.0.1:5173` made requests to `127.0.0.1:5000`
- Different origins = cookies don't work
- Got "Access denied. No token provided"

**After:**
- Frontend at `127.0.0.1:5173` makes requests to `127.0.0.1:5173/api`
- Vite proxy forwards to `127.0.0.1:5000/api`
- Same origin = cookies work!
- Backend sets cookies for `127.0.0.1:5173`
- All subsequent requests include cookies

## Success Indicators
âœ… Login works
âœ… Cookies appear under `http://127.0.0.1:5173` (not 5000!)
âœ… Dashboard loads
âœ… Patients load
âœ… No "Access denied" errors
âœ… No automatic logout

## If Vite Proxy Still Returns 404

The issue might be with POST request bodies. Check the Vite terminal for proxy logs. You should see:
```
ðŸ“¤ Proxying: POST /api/auth/login -> http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/auth/login
ðŸ“¥ Response: 200 /api/auth/login
```

If you see 404, the proxy isn't working. In that case, we need to debug the Vite proxy configuration.
