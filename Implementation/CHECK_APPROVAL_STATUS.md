# 🔍 Check Approval Status

## The modal still shows "pending" even after approval!

This could mean:
1. ✅ Approval worked but user needs to logout/login
2. ❌ Approval didn't actually update the database

## Let's Check:

```bash
cd backend
npx ts-node scripts/checkApprovalStatus.ts
```

This will show:
- Current license status in database
- Whether approval actually worked
- What the user needs to do

## Expected Results:

### If Approval Worked:
```
License Status: approved  ✅
User Status: active       ✅
License Verified At: 2025-10-08...  ✅
```

**Solution:** User just needs to logout and login again!

### If Approval Didn't Work:
```
License Status: pending  ❌
User Status: pending     ❌
```

**Solution:** Check backend logs for errors during approval.
