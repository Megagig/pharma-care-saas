# Password Change Debug - Testing Required

## Issue Reported
Password change "does not work" - even after clicking save, it reverts to the old password.

## Investigation

### Current Implementation
The password change flow should work as follows:

1. User enters current password, new password, and confirms new password
2. Frontend validates passwords match and minimum length (6 characters)
3. Backend receives request and:
   - Verifies current password is correct
   - Sets `user.passwordHash = newPassword`
   - Calls `user.save()`
   - Pre-save hook hashes the password automatically
   - Returns success

### Pre-Save Hook (User.ts)
```typescript
userSchema.pre<IUser>('save', async function (next) {
  if (!this.isModified('passwordHash')) return next();
  this.passwordHash = await bcrypt.hash(this.passwordHash, 12);
  next();
});
```

This should automatically hash the password before saving.

## Debug Logging Added

Added comprehensive logging to `/backend/src/controllers/userSettingsController.ts`:

```typescript
console.log('🔐 Changing password for user:', user.email);
console.log('📝 Old password hash (first 20 chars):', user.passwordHash.substring(0, 20));

// Update password
user.passwordHash = newPassword;
await user.save();

console.log('✅ Password changed! New hash (first 20 chars):', user.passwordHash.substring(0, 20));

// Verify the password was saved correctly
const updatedUser = await User.findById(userId).select('passwordHash');
console.log('🔍 Verification - Fetched user hash (first 20 chars):', updatedUser?.passwordHash.substring(0, 20));

// Test if new password works
const newPasswordWorks = await updatedUser?.comparePassword(newPassword);
console.log('🧪 Test - New password works?', newPasswordWorks);
```

## Testing Steps

Please try changing your password again and provide the following information:

### 1. Test Password Change
1. Go to Settings → Security & Privacy
2. Click "Change Password"
3. Enter your current password
4. Enter a new password (at least 6 characters)
5. Confirm the new password
6. Click "Save"

### 2. Check Backend Terminal
Look for these log messages in the backend terminal:
```
🔐 Changing password for user: [email]
📝 Old password hash (first 20 chars): [hash]
✅ Password changed! New hash (first 20 chars): [hash]
🔍 Verification - Fetched user hash (first 20 chars): [hash]
🧪 Test - New password works? true
```

**Copy and paste ALL the console output** from the backend terminal.

### 3. Test the New Password
After changing the password:
1. Log out of the application
2. Try to log in with the **OLD** password - it should FAIL
3. Try to log in with the **NEW** password - it should SUCCEED

### 4. What to Report
Please let me know:
- ✅ Did you see "Password changed successfully" toast message?
- ✅ What did the backend console logs show?
- ✅ Can you still log in with the OLD password?
- ✅ Can you log in with the NEW password?
- ✅ Any error messages in browser console or backend terminal?

## Possible Issues

### Issue 1: Multiple Pre-Save Hooks
There are multiple pre-save hooks in User.ts. They might be interfering with each other.

### Issue 2: Caching
The authentication system might be caching the old password hash.

### Issue 3: Token Not Invalidating
After password change, existing JWT tokens should still work (they don't check the password). You need to log out and log back in to test if the password actually changed.

## Next Steps

Based on the debug logs you provide, I can determine:
1. Is the password hash being updated in memory?
2. Is the password hash being saved to the database?
3. Does the new password work for authentication?
4. Is there a caching or session issue?
