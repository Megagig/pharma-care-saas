# Patients List Not Showing - Debug and Fix

## Problem
When logged in as super admin, the patients management page shows "No patients found" even though patients exist in the database.

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue is likely one of the following:

1. **Authentication/Role Issue**: The super admin role is not being properly recognized by the backend
2. **Workspace Filtering**: The backend is filtering patients by workplaceId even for super admins
3. **API Response Format**: The frontend is not properly parsing the API response

## Investigation Steps

### Step 1: Check Browser Console
Open browser console and check for:
- API request logs (should show the request URL)
- API response logs (should show the response data)
- Any error messages

### Step 2: Check Network Tab
1. Open DevTools Network tab
2. Filter for "patients" requests
3. Check the response:
   - Status code (should be 200)
   - Response body (should contain patient data)
   - Request headers (should include authentication cookies)

### Step 3: Backend Logs
Check backend console for:
- Authentication logs
- Request context logs (isAdmin, isSuperAdmin flags)
- Database query filters

## Quick Fix

The backend code at `backend/src/controllers/patientController.ts` line 73-75 has this logic:

```typescript
// Tenant filtering
if (!context.isAdmin) {
  filters.workplaceId = context.workplaceId;
}
```

This should work correctly if `context.isAdmin` is true for super admins.

Let's verify the authentication is working by adding debug logs.
