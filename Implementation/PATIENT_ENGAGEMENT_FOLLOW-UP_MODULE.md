Analysis Summary
Based on my review of your PharmacyCopilot application, here's what I've found:

Current State:
Existing Infrastructure:

Patient Management - Comprehensive patient records with demographics, vitals, clinical data
Visit Management - SOAP notes, attachments, visit tracking
MTR Follow-ups - Basic follow-up tracking for MTR sessions with reminders
Notification System - Robust multi-channel notification infrastructure (email, SMS, push, in-app)
Clinical Interventions - Tracking of clinical interventions and DTPs
Communication Hub - Real-time messaging and collaboration
Multi-location Support - Workplace and location-based tenancy
Gaps Identified:

‚ùå No centralized appointment scheduling system - Follow-ups exist only for MTR, not general appointments
‚ùå No unified calendar view - No way to see all appointments across patients
‚ùå No patient self-booking - All scheduling is pharmacist-initiated
‚ùå No automated appointment reminders - Reminders only exist for MTR follow-ups
‚ùå No medication refill reminders - No proactive patient engagement for refills
‚ùå No clinical event-triggered follow-ups - No automation based on lab results, medication changes, etc.
‚ùå No recurring appointment support - No way to schedule regular check-ins
Recommendation:
YES, a dedicated "Patient Engagement & Follow-up Management" module is the right approach. Here's why:

Separation of Concerns - Appointments are distinct from visits (which are retrospective clinical notes)
Reusability - Multiple modules (MTR, Diagnostics, Medications, Clinical Interventions) can leverage the same appointment system
Scalability - Centralized scheduling prevents conflicts and enables resource management
Patient-Centric - Moves from reactive to proactive care
Integration Points - Can integrate with existing Visit, MTR, Notification, and Patient modules
Integration Strategy:
The new module should:

Extend the existing Notification system (not replace it)
Complement the Visit model (appointments ‚Üí visits after completion)
Unify MTRFollowUp scheduling with general appointments
Leverage existing multi-channel communication (SMS, email, WhatsApp)
Respect existing RBAC and tenancy architecture
Now, let me create the spec for this feature.

I've created a comprehensive requirements document for the Patient Engagement & Follow-up Management module. The requirements cover:

Unified Appointment Scheduling - Centralized calendar with multiple appointment types
Smart Reminder System - Multi-channel reminders for appointments, medications, and adherence
Automated Follow-up Management - Clinical event-triggered follow-ups
Clinical Alerts & Pop-ups - Contextual alerts when viewing patient records
Recurring Appointments - Support for chronic disease monitoring
Patient Self-Service Portal - Online booking and management
Integration with Existing Modules - Seamless connection to Visit, MTR, Diagnostics, etc.
Schedule & Capacity Management - Pharmacist workload balancing
Reporting & Analytics - Performance metrics and insights
Mobile Responsiveness - Full mobile support for on-the-go access
Each requirement includes detailed acceptance criteria in EARS format (Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax) that will guide the design and implementation.

Would you like me to proceed to create the implementation task list, or would you like to modify any aspects of the design first?

Excellent! Now I'll create the implementation task list. Let me break down the design into actionable, incremental tasks.
