# ðŸš¨ QUICK FIX - DO THIS NOW ðŸš¨

## The Problem
Your API requests are returning HTML instead of JSON.

## The Solution (30 seconds)

### Step 1: Stop Frontend Server
```
Go to terminal running "npm run dev"
Press: Ctrl + C
Wait for it to stop
```

### Step 2: Start Frontend Server
```
Type: npm run dev
Press: Enter
Wait for "ready" message
```

### Step 3: Refresh Browser
```
Press: Ctrl + Shift + R (Windows/Linux)
   or: Cmd + Shift + R (Mac)
```

### Step 4: Check Console
You should now see:
```
ðŸ”µ API Request: { method: 'GET', url: '/super-admin/dashboard/overview', ... }
âœ… Super admin dashboard data received
ðŸ“Š System Stats: { totalPatients: X, ... }
```

## That's It!

The dashboard should now display data.

## Still Not Working?

### Check 1: Is backend running?
```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/health
```
Should return JSON, not error.

### Check 2: Are you logged in as super admin?
Check user object in console - should have `role: "super_admin"`

### Check 3: Check Network tab
- Open DevTools â†’ Network
- Look for `/api/super-admin/dashboard/overview`
- Should be Status 200, Response Type: json

**TL;DR**: Restart frontend dev server (Ctrl+C, then npm run dev)
