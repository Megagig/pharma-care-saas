**Scenario**: New patient with diabetes needs ongoing monitoring

**Script**:
"Let me show you a complete patient journey through our system. Meet Sarah, a 58-year-old with newly diagnosed diabetes.

[Screen: Patient record]

**Step 1: Initial Appointment**
Sarah books her first MTM session through the patient portal. The system automatically schedules reminders and sends preparation instructions.

**Step 2: Appointment Completion**
During the visit, I document her medication regimen, identify adherence barriers, and set monitoring goals. The system creates automatic follow-up tasks.

**Step 3: Automated Follow-up**
Two weeks later, a follow-up task appears to check her blood glucose logs and medication tolerance. I call Sarah, review her progress, and document outcomes.

**Step 4: Ongoing Monitoring**
The system schedules quarterly diabetes reviews and creates tasks for A1C monitoring. Sarah can book appointments online and receives proactive reminders.

**Result**: Sarah's A1C improves from 9.2% to 7.1% over six months, and she reports high satisfaction with the continuous care approach."

### Demo 2: Workflow Efficiency (3 minutes)

**Scenario**: Busy Monday morning with multiple priorities

**Script**:
"It's Monday morning, and I have 12 appointments plus 8 follow-up tasks. Let me show you how the system helps me prioritize and stay efficient.

[Screen: Dashboard view]

**Priority Triage**: The dashboard shows 2 critical tasks (medication safety issues), 4 high-priority tasks (clinical monitoring), and 2 overdue items. I start with critical tasks first.

**Batch Processing**: I group similar tasks - three blood pressure follow-ups can be handled together with similar protocols.

**Integrated Workflow**: When a follow-up task needs in-person consultation, I convert it to an appointment with one click. The patient receives automatic confirmation.

**Documentation Efficiency**: Templates and smart forms reduce documentation time by 50% while ensuring completeness.
