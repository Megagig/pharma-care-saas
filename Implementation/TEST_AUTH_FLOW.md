# Auth Flow Test

## Steps to Debug

1. **Check if login is successful**:
   - Login should return 200 with user data
   - Cookies should be set (accessToken, refreshToken)

2. **Check if /auth/me works immediately after login**:
   - Should return 200 with user data
   - Should use the accessToken cookie

3. **Check browser console for errors**

4. **Check network tab**:
   - Look for failed requests
   - Check if cookies are being sent

## Quick Fix to Try

The issue might be that the auth middleware is checking something that's failing. Let me add a bypass for the /auth/me endpoint to see if that's the issue.

## Temporary Workaround

Add console.log statements to see what's happening:

1. In `backend/src/middlewares/auth.ts` - add logging at the start
2. In `backend/src/controllers/authController.ts` getMe - add logging
3. Check browser console for frontend errors

## Most Likely Issue

The auth middleware might be rejecting requests because:
1. The token is not being sent properly
2. The token verification is failing
3. The user status check is failing

Let me check the user that's trying to login...
