# üîç Run This Inspection

## The previous script said "No broken documents" but we know they're broken!

Let's inspect the actual MongoDB document structure:

```bash
cd backend
npx ts-node scripts/inspectLicenseDocuments.ts
```

This will show:
- The EXACT structure of each `licenseDocument`
- Whether it's an empty object `{}`
- What keys it has
- What the admin query actually returns

**Run this and share the output!**

This will tell us exactly what's in MongoDB and why the admin query isn't finding the licenses.

---

**Possible scenarios:**
1. `licenseDocument` is `{}` (empty object)
2. `licenseDocument` is `null` but shows as existing
3. `licenseDocument` has some fields but not `fileName`
4. Something else entirely

The inspection script will reveal the truth! üîç
