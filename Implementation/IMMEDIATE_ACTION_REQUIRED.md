# ⚠️ IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

## Problem
The subscription plans page is not loading because the Vite proxy isn't forwarding API requests correctly.

## Quick Fix (2 minutes)

### 1. Stop Frontend Server
In your frontend terminal, press `Ctrl+C`

### 2. Restart Frontend Server
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

Wait for: `Local: http://localhost:5173/`

### 3. Clear Browser Cache
Press: `Ctrl + Shift + R` (or `Cmd + Shift + R` on Mac)

### 4. Refresh Subscriptions Page
Navigate to: `http://localhost:5173/subscriptions`

## Expected Result
You should now see:
- ✅ 6 subscription plan cards (Free Trial, Basic, Pro, Pharmily, Network, Enterprise)
- ✅ Each plan showing features
- ✅ Correct button text (Current Plan/Upgrade/Downgrade)

## If Still Not Working

### Test 1: Backend Direct Access
Open: `http://localhost:5000/api/subscriptions/plans?billingInterval=monthly`

Should show JSON data (you confirmed this works).

### Test 2: Proxy Access
Open: `http://localhost:5173/api/subscriptions/plans?billingInterval=monthly`

Should also show JSON data (if not, proxy isn't working).

### Test 3: Check Console
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Look for errors or "Plans response" log

## Why This Happened
The Vite dev server proxy needs to be restarted to properly forward API requests to the backend. This is a common issue when:
- Proxy configuration was recently changed
- Frontend server has been running for a long time
- Browser cached an HTML response
