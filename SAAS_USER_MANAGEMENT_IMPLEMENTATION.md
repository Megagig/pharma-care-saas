## User Statuses
- **pending**: User registered but not yet approved
- **active**: User approved and can access the system
- **suspended**: User suspended and cannot login
- **rejected**: User registration rejected (stored as suspended with reason)

## Email Notifications
All email notifications are sent using Resend API:
- User approval confirmation
- User rejection notification with reason
- Role assignment notification
- User suspension notification
- New user welcome email with credentials

## Security & Audit
- All actions are logged in the audit system
- Only super admins can perform these operations
- Impersonation sessions are tracked and logged
- All user state changes are recorded with timestamps
- Email failures don't block the primary operation

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test user approval flow (pending → active)
2. Test user rejection flow (pending → suspended)
3. Test bulk operations with multiple users
4. Test role assignment and email notifications
5. Test user creation and welcome email
6. Test impersonation session creation and expiry
7. Test suspension and reactivation flow
8. Verify audit logs are created for all actions
9. Test email delivery for all notification types
10. Test permission checks (only super admin access)

## Notes
- The "Add User" button is now fully functional
- Bulk operations show success/failure counts
- Email failures are logged but don't block operations
- All operations invalidate the user cache for real-time updates
- The UI shows context-appropriate actions based on user status
