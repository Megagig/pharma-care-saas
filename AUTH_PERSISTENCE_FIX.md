# Authentication Persistence Fix Summary

## Problem

Users were automatically logged out when refreshing the page, even though the application was using HTTP-only cookies for authentication.

## Root Causes Identified

1. **SameSite Cookie Policy**: Cookies were set with `sameSite: 'strict'` which can cause issues in development environments
2. **Aggressive Error Handling**: Any network error in the authentication check immediately logged out the user
3. **Lack of Retry Logic**: Network issues during page load could cause authentication failures
4. **Missing Session State Tracking**: No fallback mechanism for temporary API failures

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Backend Cookie Configuration (`authController.ts`)

- Changed `sameSite` policy from `'strict'` to `'lax'` in development
- Added environment-specific cookie settings:
   ```typescript
   sameSite: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ? 'strict' : 'lax';
   ```
- Added `checkCookies` endpoint for lightweight cookie verification

### 2. Frontend Authentication Context (`AuthContext.tsx`)

- Added retry logic with exponential backoff for network errors
- Improved error handling to distinguish between authentication failures (401) and network errors
- Added session state tracking using `sessionStorage`
- Only clear user state on definitive authentication failures (401 errors)
- Added small delay on initialization to ensure cookies are available

### 3. Authentication Service (`authService.ts`)

- Enhanced error handling with proper TypeScript error types
- Added status codes to errors for better error categorization
- Improved error propagation for better debugging

### 4. Cookie Utilities (`cookieUtils.ts`)

- Added utility functions for session state management
- Added cookie existence checking (though limited by HTTP-only nature)
- Session markers to track authentication attempts

### 5. Backend Routes (`authRoutes.ts`)

- Added new `/auth/check-cookies` endpoint for cookie verification

## Key Improvements

1. **Resilient Authentication**: The app now retries authentication checks on network errors
2. **Development-Friendly**: `sameSite: 'lax'` in development prevents cookie issues during page refresh
3. **Better Error Handling**: Distinguishes between authentication failures and temporary network issues
4. **Session Persistence**: Tracks authentication state across page refreshes
5. **Debug Support**: Added debugging information for development environments

## Security Maintained

- HTTP-only cookies still protect against XSS attacks
- Production still uses `sameSite: 'strict'` for maximum security
- No sensitive data stored in accessible storage
- CSRF protection maintained

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test login and page refresh in development
2. Test network interruption scenarios
3. Verify logout clears all session state
4. Test in production environment with `sameSite: 'strict'`

## Files Modified

### Backend

- `backend/src/controllers/authController.ts` - Cookie configuration and new endpoints
- `backend/src/routes/authRoutes.ts` - Added check-cookies route

### Frontend

- `frontend/src/context/AuthContext.tsx` - Improved authentication flow
- `frontend/src/services/authService.ts` - Better error handling
- `frontend/src/utils/cookieUtils.ts` - New utility functions

The authentication persistence issue should now be resolved while maintaining all security features and functionality of the application.
