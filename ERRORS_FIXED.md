# Errors Fixed

This document summarizes the errors that were fixed:

1. Fixed MedicationManagement.tsx to properly accept patientId prop:

   - Updated PatientMedicationsPage to accept patientId as a prop while maintaining compatibility with URL param

2. Fixed imports in components:

   - Updated React imports to use `import * as React from 'react'`
   - Fixed Material UI icon imports to use named imports
   - Removed unused imports (CardHeader, Divider, ErrorIcon)

3. Fixed Grid component implementation:

   - Updated Grid to use the new MUI v7 API with the `size` prop instead of `xs` and `md`
   - Example: `<Grid size={{ xs: 12, md: 4 }}>` instead of `<Grid item xs={12} md={4}>`

4. Fixed form value handling for date fields:

   - Added null checks for startDate and endDate in form submissions

5. Fixed unused parameters in functions:
   - Properly handled event parameters in functions

The application should now compile and run without TypeScript or ESLint errors.
