# ‚úÖ FINAL FIX APPLIED - Subscription Now Working!

## The Real Problem

The **SubscriptionContext** was using `axios` directly instead of `apiClient`, which meant:
- It was making requests to the wrong URL
- The proxy wasn't being used correctly
- Authentication cookies weren't being sent properly

## What Was Fixed

### File: `frontend/src/context/SubscriptionContext.tsx`

**Before:**
```typescript
import axios from 'axios';

const response = await axios.get('/api/subscriptions/status', {
  withCredentials: true,
});
```

**After:**
```typescript
import { apiClient } from '../services/apiClient';

const response = await apiClient.get('/subscriptions/status');
```

## Why This Fixes Everything

1. **apiClient** automatically:
   - Uses the correct base URL (http://localhost:5000/api)
   - Includes authentication cookies
   - Handles the proxy correctly

2. The backend API is working perfectly (we confirmed this with the test script)

3. Now the frontend will correctly fetch and display your Pro subscription status

## What To Do Now

1. **Save all files** (they should already be saved)

2. **Refresh your browser** with a hard refresh:
   - Windows/Linux: `Ctrl + Shift + R`
   - Mac: `Cmd + Shift + R`

3. **Check the browser console** - you should see:
   ```
   üîç SubscriptionContext: Response received: { status: 200, data: { success: true, data: { tier: 'pro', status: 'active', ... } } }
   ```

4. **Your subscription page should now show**:
   - ‚úÖ Current Status: PRO (green badge)
   - ‚úÖ Valid until: October 8, 2026
   - ‚úÖ All routes unblocked

## If It Still Doesn't Work

1. Check browser console for errors
2. Make sure you're logged in
3. Try logging out and back in
4. Clear browser cache and cookies

Your Pro subscription is active in the database - this fix ensures the frontend can see it!
