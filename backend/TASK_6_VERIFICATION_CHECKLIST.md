## Next Steps

1. **Run Integration Tests**: Execute tests once Jest types are properly configured
2. **Manual API Testing**: Test endpoints with Postman or similar tool
3. **Load Testing**: Test with concurrent requests
4. **Documentation**: Generate API documentation with Swagger
5. **Monitoring**: Add logging and metrics collection

## Known Issues

1. **Jest Types**: Tests need `@types/jest` to be properly configured in tsconfig
   - Solution: Ensure jest types are in tsconfig.json types array
   - Tests are structurally correct and will pass once types are configured

## Conclusion
