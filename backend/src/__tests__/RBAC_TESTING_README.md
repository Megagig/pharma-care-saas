# RBAC Testing Suite

This comprehensive testing suite validates the dynamic RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) system implementation. The suite includes unit tests, integration tests, performance tests, and security tests to ensure the system is robust, secure, and performant.

## Test Structure

### ðŸ“‹ Unit Tests (`/services/`, `/migrations/`)

- **DynamicPermissionService.test.ts**: Core permission resolution logic
- **RoleHierarchyService.test.ts**: Role hierarchy management and inheritance
- **CacheManager.test.ts**: Redis caching functionality
- **rbacMigration.test.ts**: Migration scripts validation

### ðŸ”„ Integration Tests (`/integration/`)

- **rbacWorkflows.test.ts**: End-to-end RBAC workflows including role assignment, permission checking, real-time updates, and error handling

### âš¡ Performance Tests (`/performance/`)

- **rbacPerformance.test.ts**: Load testing, concurrency testing, memory usage, and cache performance validation

### ðŸ”’ Security Tests (`/security/`)

- **rbacSecurity.test.ts**: Security vulnerability testing, privilege escalation prevention, and audit logging validation

## Performance Thresholds

| Metric           | Threshold | Description                               |
| ---------------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Permission Check | < 100ms   | Individual permission check response time |
| Bulk Operations  | < 5000ms  | Bulk role assignment operations           |
| Cache Hit Ratio  | > 80%     | Cache effectiveness ratio                 |
| Memory Usage     | < 50MB    | Memory increase during operations         |

## Coverage Requirements

| Component                | Functions | Lines | Branches |
| ------------------------ | --------- | ----- | -------- |
| DynamicPermissionService | 90%       | 90%   | 85%      |
| RoleHierarchyService     | 85%       | 85%   | 80%      |
| CacheManager             | 80%       | 80%   | 75%      |
| Overall                  | 85%       | 85%   | 80%      |

## Test Data Setup

The tests use the following test data structure:

- **1000 test users** with various role assignments
- **10 test roles** with 3-level hierarchy
- **50 test permissions** across different categories
- **Test workplace** for workspace-scoped operations

## Security Test Categories

1. **Privilege Escalation Prevention**

   - Prevents users from assigning admin roles to themselves
   - Prevents unauthorized direct permission grants
   - Prevents role hierarchy manipulation

2. **Unauthorized Access Prevention**

   - Blocks suspended users
   - Validates authentication tokens
   - Prevents cross-workspace access

3. **Permission Bypass Vulnerabilities**

   - Cache poisoning protection
   - SQL/NoSQL injection prevention
   - Timing attack mitigation

4. **Audit Logging Security**

   - Complete audit trail validation
   - Failed attempt logging
   - Audit log tampering prevention

5. **Session Security**

   - Session invalidation on permission changes
   - Session fixation attack prevention

6. **Input Validation Security**

   - Role name sanitization
   - Permission format validation
   - Buffer overflow protection

7. **Rate Limiting Security**

   - Brute force prevention
   - DoS attack mitigation

8. **Data Integrity Security**
   - Concurrent modification handling
   - Referential integrity maintenance

## Performance Test Scenarios

1. **Permission Check Performance**

   - 1000 concurrent permission checks
   - Cache warming validation
   - Response time measurement

2. **Role Hierarchy Performance**

   - Deep hierarchy traversal (8 levels)
   - Circular dependency detection
   - Inheritance resolution timing

3. **Cache Performance**

   - Cache hit ratio validation
   - Cache invalidation efficiency
   - Memory usage monitoring

4. **Bulk Operations Performance**

   - 500 user bulk role assignments
   - Concurrent bulk operations
   - Transaction integrity

5. **Stress Testing**
   - High concurrency (100 concurrent batches)
   - Sustained load testing (10 seconds)
   - Memory cleanup validation

## Test Reports

The test suite generates comprehensive reports:

### JSON Reports

- `rbac-test-summary-{timestamp}.json`: Overall test summary
- `rbac-{type}-tests-{timestamp}.json`: Detailed results by test type
- `rbac-performance-metrics-{timestamp}.json`: Performance metrics
- `rbac-security-report-{timestamp}.json`: Security test results

### HTML Report

- `rbac-test-report-{timestamp}.html`: Interactive HTML report with metrics and test details

### Coverage Reports

- `coverage/rbac/`: HTML coverage reports
- `coverage/rbac/lcov.info`: LCOV format for CI/CD integration

## CI/CD Integration

The test suite is designed for CI/CD integration:

```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions workflow
- name: Run RBAC Tests
  run: |
    npm run test:rbac:unit
    npm run test:rbac:integration
    npm run test:rbac:security
    npm run test:rbac:coverage

- name: Upload Coverage
  uses: codecov/codecov-action@v3
  with:
    file: ./backend/coverage/rbac/lcov.info
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **MongoDB Memory Server Issues**

   - Ensure sufficient memory allocation
   - Check for port conflicts

2. **Redis Connection Issues**

   - Verify Redis is running for cache tests
   - Check Redis configuration

3. **Performance Test Failures**

   - Adjust thresholds for slower environments
   - Ensure adequate system resources

4. **Security Test Failures**
   - Verify audit logging is enabled
   - Check authentication middleware setup

### Debug Mode

Run tests with verbose output:

```bash
DEBUG=* npm run test:rbac
```

## Contributing

When adding new RBAC functionality:

1. Add corresponding unit tests
2. Update integration tests if workflows change
3. Add performance tests for new operations
4. Include security tests for new permissions
5. Update coverage thresholds if needed
6. Document any new test scenarios

## Dependencies

The test suite requires:

- Jest testing framework
- MongoDB Memory Server
- Redis (for cache tests)
- Supertest (for API testing)
- TypeScript support

All dependencies are included in the project's package.json.
