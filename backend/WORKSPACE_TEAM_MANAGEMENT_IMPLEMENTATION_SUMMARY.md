# Workspace Team Management - Task 3 Implementation Summary

## Overview
Task 3 of the Workspace Team Management feature has been successfully implemented. This task focused on creating the member management API endpoints with proper workspace isolation, authentication, and validation.

## Implemented Components

### 1. Controller (`backend/src/controllers/workspaceTeamController.ts`)
Created a comprehensive controller with three main endpoints:

#### GET /api/workspace/team/members
- Retrieves all members in the workspace with pagination
- Supports filtering by role, status, and search by name/email
- Returns paginated results with member details
- Excludes sensitive fields (passwordHash, tokens, etc.)
- Enforces workspace isolation

#### PUT /api/workspace/team/members/:id
- Updates a member's workplace role
- Validates role against allowed values
- Ensures member belongs to the same workspace
- Records audit information (old role, new role, reason, updatedBy)
- Updates role modification timestamps

#### DELETE /api/workspace/team/members/:id
- Removes a member from the workspace
- Prevents removal of workspace owners
- Sets member status to suspended
- Records suspension reason and metadata
- Enforces workspace isolation

### 2. Routes (`backend/src/routes/workspaceTeamRoutes.ts`)
Created RESTful routes with comprehensive validation:

- **Authentication**: All routes require authentication via `auth` middleware
- **Authorization**: All routes require workspace owner role via `requireWorkspaceOwner` middleware
- **Validation**: Uses express-validator for input validation:
  - Query parameters (page, limit, search, role, status)
  - Path parameters (MongoDB ObjectId validation)
  - Body parameters (workplaceRole, reason)

### 3. Integration with Main App (`backend/src/app.ts`)
- Registered routes at `/api/workspace/team`
- Properly positioned in middleware chain after authentication setup
- Follows existing route registration patterns

### 4. Comprehensive Tests (`backend/src/__tests__/routes/workspaceTeamRoutes.test.ts`)
Created extensive integration tests covering:

#### Authentication & Authorization Tests
- Rejects requests without authentication token
- Rejects requests from non-workspace owners
- Allows requests from workspace owners

#### GET /members Tests
- Returns all members in workspace
- Supports pagination correctly
- Filters by role
- Filters by status
- Searches by name or email
- Does not expose sensitive fields
- Only returns members from same workspace

#### PUT /members/:id Tests
- Updates member role successfully
- Rejects invalid workplace roles
- Rejects updates for members not in workspace
- Validates member ID format

#### DELETE /members/:id Tests
- Removes member from workspace successfully
- Prevents removing workspace owner
- Rejects removal for members not in workspace
- Validates member ID format

#### Workspace Isolation Tests
- Enforces workspace isolation across all endpoints
- Verifies owners can only see/manage their own workspace members

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Workspace Isolation
- All queries filter by `workplaceId` from authenticated user
- No cross-workspace data access possible
- Middleware attaches `workplaceId` to request object

### 2. Security
- Authentication required on all endpoints
- Authorization limited to workspace owners (pharmacy_outlet role)
- Input validation on all parameters
- Sensitive fields excluded from responses
- MongoDB ObjectId validation

### 3. Data Integrity
- Role validation against allowed values
- Prevents removal of workspace owners
- Audit trail information recorded
- Timestamps updated appropriately

### 4. Performance
- Pagination support for large member lists
- Efficient MongoDB queries with proper indexing
- Lean queries for better performance

### 5. Error Handling
- Comprehensive error messages
- Proper HTTP status codes
- Validation error details
- Not found handling

  "member": {
    "_id": "...",
    "firstName": "John",
    "lastName": "Doe",
    "email": "john@example.com",

### DELETE /api/workspace/team/members/:id
**Body:**
```json
{
  "reason": "No longer needed"
