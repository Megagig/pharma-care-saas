## Route Integration

### Updated Communication Routes

Added audit middleware to key communication endpoints:

- `POST /conversations` - Conversation creation
- `POST /conversations/:id/messages` - Message sending
- `PUT /messages/:id/read` - Message reading
- `POST /conversations/:id/participants` - Participant addition
- `DELETE /conversations/:id/participants/:userId` - Participant removal
- `POST /upload` - File uploads
- `GET /search/messages` - Message search
- `GET /patients/:patientId/conversations` - Patient communication access

### New Audit Endpoints

- `GET /api/communication/audit/logs` - Retrieve audit logs
- `GET /api/communication/audit/conversations/:id/logs` - Conversation-specific logs
- `GET /api/communication/audit/high-risk` - High-risk activities
- `GET /api/communication/audit/compliance-report` - Compliance reporting
- `GET /api/communication/audit/export` - Data export
- `GET /api/communication/audit/users/:id/activity` - User activity
- `GET /api/communication/audit/statistics` - Audit statistics
- `GET /api/communication/audit/search` - Search audit logs

## Testing Implementation

### Test Coverage
