# Workspace Owner Authentication Middleware - Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of the `requireWorkspaceOwner` middleware for the Workspace Team Management system.

## Implementation Details

### Location
- **Middleware**: `backend/src/middlewares/rbac.ts` (lines 723-790)
- **Tests**: `backend/src/__tests__/middlewares/requireWorkspaceOwner.test.ts`

### Functionality

The `requireWorkspaceOwner` middleware validates that the authenticated user is the owner of their workspace and provides the following features:

1. **Authentication Check**: Verifies that `req.user` exists
2. **Workspace Context Validation**: Ensures `req.workspaceContext.workspace` is loaded
3. **Ownership Verification**: Confirms the user is the workspace owner by comparing `workspace.ownerId` with `user._id`
4. **Super Admin Bypass**: Allows super admins to access any workspace
5. **WorkplaceId Attachment**: Attaches `workplaceId` to the request object for convenient access in route handlers
6. **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Returns appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages

### Usage Example

```typescript
import { requireWorkspaceOwner } from '../middlewares/rbac';

// Apply to routes that require workspace owner access
router.get('/api/workspace/team/members', 
  auth,                      // Authentication middleware
  loadWorkspaceContext,      // Load workspace context
  requireWorkspaceOwner,     // Validate workspace ownership
  getTeamMembers             // Route handler
);
```

### Error Responses

#### 401 - Authentication Required
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Authentication required",
  "error": "User not authenticated"
}
```

#### 403 - No Workspace
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "No workspace associated with user",
  "error": "Access denied"
}
```

#### 403 - Not Owner
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Workspace owner access required",
  "error": "Only workspace owners can access this resource"
}
```

#### 403 - No Owner Assigned
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Workspace owner access required",
  "error": "Workspace has no owner assigned"
}
```

### Request Object Enhancement

After successful validation, the middleware attaches the `workplaceId` to the request:

```typescript
// In route handlers, you can now access:
const workplaceId = (req as any).workplaceId;
// or
const workplaceId = req.workspaceContext.workspace._id;
```

## Test Coverage

### Test Suite: `requireWorkspaceOwner.test.ts`

**Total Tests**: 22 tests, all passing ✅

#### Test Categories

1. **Successful Authorization** (4 tests)
   - ✅ Allows access when user is workspace owner
   - ✅ Attaches workplaceId to request when user is owner
   - ✅ Allows super_admin to bypass ownership checks
   - ✅ Attaches workplaceId for super_admin

2. **Authentication Errors** (2 tests)
   - ✅ Returns 401 when user is not authenticated
   - ✅ Returns 401 when user is null

3. **Workspace Context Errors** (3 tests)
   - ✅ Returns 403 when workspaceContext is missing
   - ✅ Returns 403 when workspace is null
   - ✅ Returns 403 when workspace is undefined

4. **Ownership Validation** (3 tests)
   - ✅ Returns 403 when user is not the workspace owner
   - ✅ Does not attach workplaceId when user is not owner
   - ✅ Handles ObjectId comparison correctly

5. **Role-Based Access** (3 tests)
   - ✅ Denies access for pharmacy_team role even if in workspace
   - ✅ Denies access for pharmacist role even if in workspace
   - ✅ Allows access for pharmacy_outlet role when they are owner

6. **Edge Cases** (3 tests)
   - ✅ Handles missing user role gracefully
   - ✅ Handles workspace without ownerId
   - ✅ Handles workspace without _id

7. **Response Format** (2 tests)
   - ✅ Returns consistent error format for authentication failure
   - ✅ Returns consistent error format for authorization failure

8. **Integration Scenarios** (2 tests)
   - ✅ Works in typical authenticated request flow
   - ✅ Prevents cross-workspace access

### Running Tests

```bash
cd backend
npm test -- requireWorkspaceOwner.test.ts --runInBand
```

## Requirements Satisfied

✅ **REQ-008**: Access Control
- Only workspace owners can access team management
- Workspace data is properly isolated
- Backend validation ensures security
- Access attempts are logged

### Task Checklist

- ✅ Create requireWorkspaceOwner middleware function
- ✅ Add workspace ownership validation logic
- ✅ Attach workplaceId to request object
- ✅ Add error handling for unauthorized access
- ✅ Write unit tests for middleware

## Integration Notes

### Prerequisites

The middleware requires these middlewares to run before it:
1. `auth` - Authenticates the user and attaches `req.user`
2. `loadWorkspaceContext` - Loads workspace context and attaches `req.workspaceContext`

### Middleware Chain Example

```typescript
import { auth } from '../middlewares/auth';
import { loadWorkspaceContext } from '../middlewares/workspaceContext';
import { requireWorkspaceOwner } from '../middlewares/rbac';

router.use('/api/workspace/team', [
  auth,
  loadWorkspaceContext,
  requireWorkspaceOwner
]);
```

## Security Considerations

1. **Workspace Isolation**: All queries must filter by the attached `workplaceId`
2. **Super Admin Access**: Super admins can access any workspace (by design)
3. **ObjectId Comparison**: Uses `.toString()` for safe comparison
4. **No Role Bypass**: Only super_admin role bypasses ownership checks
5. **Error Messages**: Carefully crafted to not leak sensitive information

## Performance

- **Synchronous Operation**: No database queries, uses cached workspace context
- **Minimal Overhead**: Simple comparison operations
- **Early Returns**: Fails fast on authentication/authorization errors

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future iterations:
- Add audit logging for access attempts
- Support for delegated ownership
- Temporary ownership transfer
- Multi-owner workspaces
