## Business Rules Implemented

### Automated Follow-up Creation (Requirement 3.1, 3.2)
1. **High-risk medications** → 7-day follow-up, high priority
2. **Abnormal lab results** → 3-day follow-up, high priority
3. **Hospital discharge** → 2-day follow-up, urgent priority
4. **Medication changes** → 14-day follow-up, medium priority
5. **Stable chronic patients** → 90-day follow-up, medium priority
6. **Unstable chronic patients** → 30-day follow-up, high priority
7. **Missed appointments** → 1-day follow-up, high priority

### Priority Escalation (Requirement 3.6)
- Automatic escalation for overdue tasks (to be implemented in background jobs)
- Manual escalation with reason tracking
- Escalation history maintained for audit trail

### Task Completion (Requirement 3.4)
- Outcome status: successful, partially_successful, unsuccessful
- Next actions tracking
- Optional appointment creation link

## Performance Considerations

### Database Queries
- Efficient compound indexes used
- Pagination support for large result sets
- Aggregation pipelines for statistics
- Optional population to reduce queries

### Caching Opportunities (Future)
- Task summary statistics
- Frequently accessed patient tasks
- Pharmacist workload metrics

## Security & Compliance

### Data Validation
- All user inputs validated
- SQL injection prevention (parameterized queries)
- XSS prevention (data sanitization)

### Audit Trail
- All operations logged
- User tracking (createdBy, updatedBy, completedBy, escalatedBy)
- Timestamp tracking for all state changes
- Escalation history preserved

### Workspace Isolation
- All queries scoped to workplaceId
- Tenancy guard plugin applied
- Location-based filtering supported

## Next Steps
