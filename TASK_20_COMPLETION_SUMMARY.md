## Next Steps for Manual Testing

To complete Task 20, follow these steps:

### 1. Start the Servers

**Terminal 1 - Backend:**
```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

**Terminal 2 - Frontend:**
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

### 2. Run the Integration Test Script

```bash
./test-admin-feature-management-integration.sh
```

This will verify that both servers are running and routes are accessible.

2. ⬜ Login as super admin
3. ⬜ Navigate to feature management
4. ⬜ Create new feature
5. ⬜ Verify feature in list
6. ⬜ Edit feature
7. ⬜ Toggle tier access
8. ⬜ Delete feature
9. ⬜ Test non-admin access
10. ⬜ Verify workspace features
11. ⬜ Check console errors
12. ⬜ Test mobile responsiveness
13. ⬜ Run E2E tests

### 4. Run Automated E2E Tests

## Known Considerations

### Prerequisites for Manual Testing

1. **Super Admin Account Required**
   - You need a user account with `role: 'super_admin'`
   - If you don't have one, create it using backend scripts

2. **Regular User Account Required**
   - Needed for testing access control (Test 9)
   - Should have role like 'pharmacist' or 'owner'

3. **Existing Workspace Features**
   - For backward compatibility testing (Test 10)
   - Should have some workspace-level feature flags

### Environment Setup

Ensure your `.env` files are properly configured:

**Backend `.env`:**
```env
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=5000
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/pharmacare
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
```

**Frontend `.env`:**
```env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### If Backend Won't Start
```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm run dev
```

### If Frontend Won't Start
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

### If Routes Return 404
- Verify routes are registered in `backend/src/app.ts`
- Check that `featureFlagRoutes` is imported
- Restart backend server

### If Authentication Fails
- Check JWT token in browser cookies
- Verify user role is 'super_admin'
- Try logging out and back in

### If E2E Tests Fail
- Ensure both servers are running
- Check test configuration in `playwright.config.ts`
- Review test output for specific failures
