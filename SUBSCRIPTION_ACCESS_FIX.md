# Subscription Access Fix - Complete Solution

## Problem Summary

Users on free trial cannot access AI diagnostic and therapeutic modules even after upgrading to Basic or Pro plans. The error message displayed is:

```
Permission Error: Feature not available in your current plan.
```

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. **Critical Bug: userId vs workspaceId Mismatch** ‚ö†Ô∏è (FIXED)

The Subscription model expects `workspaceId`, but the subscription controller was using `userId` in multiple places:

**Affected Methods:**
- `handleSuccessfulPayment()` - Line 720: Creating subscriptions with `userId` instead of `workspaceId`
- `handleSuccessfulPayment()` - Line 710: Canceling old subscriptions using `userId`
- `cancelSubscription()` - Line 773: Querying subscriptions by `userId`
- `upgradeSubscription()` - Line 847: Querying subscriptions by `userId`
- `downgradeSubscription()` - Line 983: Querying subscriptions by `userId`

**Impact:**
- New subscriptions created after payment have the wrong field
- System cannot find subscriptions when checking feature access
- Users appear to have no active subscription even after successful payment
- Feature access checks fail because subscription tier cannot be determined

### 2. **Feature Flag Configuration** (FIXED)

AI diagnostic features were missing `basic` and `pro` tiers in their `allowedTiers` configuration. The features were only configured for `free_trial, pharmily, network, enterprise`, excluding paying Basic and Pro customers.

## Solutions Implemented

### ‚úÖ Fix 1: Corrected Subscription Controller

**File:** `backend/src/controllers/subscriptionController.ts`

**Changes Made:**
1. Updated `handleSuccessfulPayment()` to use `workspaceId` instead of `userId`
2. Updated `cancelSubscription()` to use `workspaceId` instead of `userId`
3. Updated `upgradeSubscription()` to use `workspaceId` instead of `userId`
4. Updated `downgradeSubscription()` to use `workspaceId` instead of `userId`
5. Added validation to ensure user has a `workplaceId` before processing

### ‚úÖ Fix 2: Database Migration Script

**File:** `backend/src/scripts/fixSubscriptionWorkspaceId.ts`

This script:
- Finds all subscriptions with `userId` field
- Looks up the user's `workplaceId`
- Updates subscriptions to use `workspaceId`
- Removes the old `userId` field

### ‚úÖ Fix 3: Feature Flag Verification Script

**File:** `backend/src/scripts/verifyAIDiagnosticFeatures.ts`

This script ensures AI diagnostic features are properly configured:
- `ai_diagnostics` - Available on: free_trial, pharmily, network, enterprise
- `clinical_decision_support` - Available on: free_trial, pharmily, network, enterprise
- `drug_information` - Available on: all tiers

## How to Apply the Fix

### Step 1: Stop the Backend Server

```bash
# If running in development
# Press Ctrl+C to stop the server
```

### Step 2: Run the Database Migration

```bash
cd backend
npx ts-node src/scripts/fixSubscriptionWorkspaceId.ts
```

**Expected Output:**
```
üîß Starting subscription workspaceId migration...
‚úÖ Connected to MongoDB

üìä Found X total subscriptions

‚úÖ Fixed subscription 123abc...
   User: user@example.com
   Workspace: 456def...
   Tier: basic
   Status: active

üìä Migration Summary:
   ‚úÖ Fixed: X
   ‚è≠Ô∏è  Skipped: Y
   ‚ùå Errors: 0
   üìä Total: Z

‚úÖ Migration completed successfully!
```

### Step 3: Verify Feature Flags

```bash
cd backend
npx ts-node src/scripts/verifyAIDiagnosticFeatures.ts
```

**Expected Output:**
```
üîß Starting AI Diagnostic Feature Flags verification...
‚úÖ Connected to MongoDB

üìã Checking feature: AI Diagnostics (ai_diagnostics)
   ‚úÖ Updated feature flag
   üìä Configuration:
      - Allowed Tiers: free_trial, pharmily, network, enterprise
      - Allowed Roles: pharmacist, pharmacy_team, pharmacy_outlet, super_admin, owner
      - Active: true
      - License Required: true

‚úÖ All AI Diagnostic features verified successfully!
```

### Step 4: Restart the Backend Server

```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

### Step 5: Clear Frontend Cache and Refresh

**For Users:**
1. Log out of the application
2. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
3. Log back in
4. Navigate to the AI Diagnostic module

**For Developers:**
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

## Verification Steps

### 1. Check Subscription Status

```bash
# In MongoDB shell or Compass
db.subscriptions.find({ workspaceId: { $exists: true } })
```

Should show subscriptions with `workspaceId` field.

### 2. Check Feature Flags

```bash
# In MongoDB shell or Compass
db.featureflags.find({ key: { $in: ['ai_diagnostics', 'clinical_decision_support', 'drug_information'] } })
```

Should show:
- `isActive: true`
- Correct `allowedTiers` arrays

### 3. Test Feature Access

1. Log in as a user with Basic or Pro subscription
2. Navigate to AI Diagnostics module
3. Should see the module content instead of permission error

## Understanding the Fix

### Before Fix:
```typescript
// ‚ùå WRONG: Creating subscription with userId
const subscription = new Subscription({
  userId: userId,  // This field doesn't exist in Subscription model!
  planId: planId,
  tier: plan.tier,
  // ...
});

// ‚ùå WRONG: Querying by userId
const subscription = await Subscription.findOne({
  userId: req.user._id,  // This will never find anything!
  status: 'active'
});
```

### After Fix:
```typescript
// ‚úÖ CORRECT: Creating subscription with workspaceId
const subscription = new Subscription({
  workspaceId: user.workplaceId,  // Correct field!
  planId: planId,
  tier: plan.tier,
  // ...
});

// ‚úÖ CORRECT: Querying by workspaceId
const subscription = await Subscription.findOne({
  workspaceId: req.user.workplaceId,  // This will find the subscription!
  status: 'active'
});
```

## Feature Access Flow

```
User makes payment
    ‚Üì
handleSuccessfulPayment() called
    ‚Üì
Creates Subscription with workspaceId ‚úÖ
    ‚Üì
User tries to access AI Diagnostics
    ‚Üì
Auth middleware checks feature access
    ‚Üì
Finds subscription by workspaceId ‚úÖ
    ‚Üì
Checks subscription.tier against featureFlag.allowedTiers
    ‚Üì
Access granted! ‚úÖ
```

## Tier Access Matrix

| Feature | Free Trial | Basic | Pro | Pharmily | Network | Enterprise |
|---------|-----------|-------|-----|----------|---------|------------|
| AI Diagnostics | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| Clinical Decision Support | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| Drug Information | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |

**Note:** Free trial users have access to AI Diagnostics during their 14-day trial period.

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Migration script shows "User has no workplaceId"

**Solution:** Users must be assigned to a workplace before they can have subscriptions. Create a workplace for the user first.

### Issue: Still getting permission error after migration

**Possible Causes:**
1. Frontend cache not cleared - Clear browser cache and refresh
2. User session not refreshed - Log out and log back in
3. Feature flag not active - Run the feature flag verification script
4. User's license not approved - Check `user.licenseStatus` should be 'approved'

### Issue: Feature flag says "License Required"

**Solution:** AI diagnostic features require an approved pharmacist license. Check:
```javascript
user.licenseStatus === 'approved'
```

## Additional Notes

### Why workspaceId instead of userId?

The system is designed for multi-user workspaces where:
- Multiple users can belong to one workplace
- One subscription covers the entire workplace
- All users in a workplace share the same subscription tier

This is why subscriptions are tied to `workplaceId` not `userId`.

### Future Prevention

To prevent this issue in the future:
1. Always use TypeScript strict mode
2. Use the Subscription model's TypeScript interface
3. Add integration tests for subscription creation
4. Add database schema validation

## Files Modified

1. ‚úÖ `backend/src/controllers/subscriptionController.ts` - Fixed userId/workspaceId bugs
2. ‚úÖ `backend/src/scripts/fixSubscriptionWorkspaceId.ts` - New migration script
3. ‚úÖ `backend/src/scripts/verifyAIDiagnosticFeatures.ts` - New verification script
4. ‚úÖ `SUBSCRIPTION_ACCESS_FIX.md` - This documentation

## Support

If issues persist after applying this fix, check:
1. MongoDB connection is working
2. User has a valid workplaceId
3. Subscription status is 'active' or 'trial'
4. Feature flags are active in database
5. User's license is approved (for AI features)

For additional help, check the application logs for detailed error messages.
