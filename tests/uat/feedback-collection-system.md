## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive feedback collection system for the Patient Engagement & Follow-up Management module UAT. It includes standardized forms, data collection methods, and analysis frameworks to ensure thorough evaluation of the system.

## Feedback Collection Methods

### 1. System Usability Scale (SUS) Questionnaire

**Instructions**: For each statement, mark the response that most closely matches your experience.

**Scale**: 1 = Strongly Disagree, 2 = Disagree, 3 = Neutral, 4 = Agree, 5 = Strongly Agree

| Statement | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
|-----------|---|---|---|---|---|
| I think that I would like to use this system frequently | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ |
| I found the system unnecessarily complex | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ |
