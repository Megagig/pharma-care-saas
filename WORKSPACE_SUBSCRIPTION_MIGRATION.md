# Workspace Subscription System Migration

This document outlines the migration from individual user subscriptions to a unified workspace-based subscription system.

## 🎯 What Changed

### Before (Individual Subscriptions)
- Users had individual `subscriptionTier` field
- Feature access was inconsistent between individual tiers and workspace subscriptions
- Two parallel systems causing confusion and 403 errors

### After (Unified Workspace Subscriptions)
- **Single source of truth**: Workspace-based subscriptions only
- All users must belong to a workspace to use the application
- Feature access controlled dynamically via Feature Management
- Clean, maintainable codebase

## 🚀 Migration Steps

### 1. Run the Migration Script

```bash
cd backend
npm run setup:workspace-subscriptions
```

This script will:
- ✅ Setup feature flags for all 6 tiers (free_trial, basic, pro, pharmily, network, enterprise)
- ✅ Create personal workspaces for users without workspaces
- ✅ Create 14-day trial subscriptions for all workspaces
- ✅ Migrate existing users to workspace-based system

### 2. Verify Migration

Check that:
- All users have `workplaceId` assigned
- All workspaces have active subscriptions
- Feature flags are properly configured
- Diagnostic access works for trial users

## 📋 Key Features

### ✅ 14-Day Free Trial
- Automatically starts when user creates/joins workspace
- Access to ALL features except admin areas
- No credit card required

### ✅ Workspace-Based Access
- Users must create or join a workspace
- One subscription per workspace
- All workspace members share the subscription

### ✅ Dynamic Feature Control
- Feature Management page controls access
- Add/remove features from tiers without code changes
- Both monthly & yearly plans supported

### ✅ Admin Area Protection
- Only super_admin can access `/admin/*` routes:
  - Admin Panel
  - Audit Trail
  - Feature Management
  - Feature Flags
  - SaaS Settings
  - User Management

## 🔧 Technical Changes

### Models Updated
- ✅ `User.ts` - Removed individual subscription fields
- ✅ `Workplace.ts` - Enhanced with subscription tracking
- ✅ `Subscription.ts` - Already workspace-based

### Middleware Updated
- ✅ `auth.ts` - Updated `requireFeature` for workspace subscriptions
- ✅ Added trial expiration checks
- ✅ Added workspace requirement validation

### Frontend Updated
- ✅ `ProtectedRoute.tsx` - Added admin route blocking
- ✅ `FeatureManagement.tsx` - Shows all 6 tiers
- ✅ `useRBAC.tsx` - Updated for workspace-based features

### Services Added
- ✅ `WorkspaceSubscriptionService` - Handles subscription creation and management
- ✅ Auto-creates trial subscriptions for new workspaces
- ✅ Migration utilities for existing users

## 🎉 Expected Results

After migration:
- ✅ Loveth's diagnostic access issue resolved
- ✅ All users have 14-day trial access to full features
- ✅ Feature Management controls access dynamically
- ✅ Clean, single-source-of-truth architecture
- ✅ No more 403 errors due to subscription conflicts

## 🚨 Important Notes

1. **Backup Database**: Always backup before running migration
2. **Test Environment**: Run migration in test environment first
3. **User Communication**: Inform users about workspace requirement
4. **Admin Access**: Only super_admin can access admin features

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### If users still get 403 errors:
1. Check if user has `workplaceId`
2. Verify workspace has active subscription
3. Confirm feature flag exists and is active
4. Check if trial has expired

### If Feature Management doesn't show all tiers:
1. Run `npm run setup:feature-flags`
2. Verify feature flags are created
3. Check frontend constants are updated

### If migration fails:
1. Check MongoDB connection
2. Verify all required models exist
3. Check console logs for specific errors
4. Run individual scripts separately

## 📞 Support

If you encounter issues during migration, check:
1. Console logs for detailed error messages
2. Database state before and after migration
3. Feature flag configuration
4. Workspace subscription status

The system is now unified, maintainable, and provides a better user experience with clear trial access and dynamic feature control.
