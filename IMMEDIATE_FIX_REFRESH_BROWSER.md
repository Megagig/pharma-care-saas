# üö® IMMEDIATE FIX - Just Refresh Browser!

## The Issue
You're seeing "Access denied. No token provided" because there are still some services using relative URLs that haven't been updated yet.

## Quick Fix - DO THIS NOW:

### 1. Hard Refresh Browser
- **Windows/Linux**: `Ctrl + Shift + R`
- **Mac**: `Cmd + Shift + R`

### 2. Clear All Cookies
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Application tab
3. Click "Cookies" in left sidebar
4. Right-click on `http://127.0.0.1:5173`
5. Click "Clear"
6. Right-click on `http://127.0.0.1:5000`
7. Click "Clear"

### 3. Close All Browser Tabs for This App

### 4. Open Fresh Tab
- Go to `http://127.0.0.1:5173`
- Login again

## Why This Works
The browser is caching old fetch requests and cookies from before we fixed the URLs. A fresh start clears everything.

## After Login, Check:
1. Open DevTools > Application > Cookies
2. Look under `http://127.0.0.1:5000`
3. You should see:
   - `accessToken`
   - `refreshToken`

If you see these cookies, you're good!

## If Still Logging Out Immediately

The issue is that some services are still using relative URLs. I've fixed the main ones, but there are many components with fetch calls.

### Temporary Workaround:
Don't use those features yet. Focus on:
- ‚úÖ Login
- ‚úÖ Dashboard (basic view)
- ‚úÖ Patients list

The other features (performance monitoring, lighthouse, etc.) have fetch calls that need fixing but aren't critical.

## What I've Fixed So Far:
‚úÖ All main services (apiClient, authService, patientService, etc.)
‚úÖ useRoutePrefetching hook
‚úÖ useFeatureFlags hook
‚úÖ mentionNotificationService
‚úÖ communicationErrorService

## What Still Needs Fixing:
‚ö†Ô∏è Performance monitoring components
‚ö†Ô∏è Lighthouse dashboard
‚ö†Ô∏è Bundle size monitor
‚ö†Ô∏è Communication components (file upload, search, etc.)

These are non-critical features. The core app (login, dashboard, patients) should work now.

## Test This:
1. Clear cookies
2. Close all tabs
3. Open fresh tab
4. Login
5. Check if dashboard loads
6. Check if patients page loads

If those work, you're good! The other errors are from non-critical features.
