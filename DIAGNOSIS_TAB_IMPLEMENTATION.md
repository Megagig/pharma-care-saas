# Diagnosis Tab Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully added a new "Diagnosis" tab to the Patient Management interface that displays all AI diagnostic cases for a patient.

## Changes Made

### 1. New Component Created
**File**: `frontend/src/components/PatientDiagnosisList.tsx`

**Features**:
- Displays all AI diagnostic cases for a specific patient
- Shows summary statistics (Total Cases, Pending Review, Completed)
- Table view with columns:
  - Case ID (first 8 characters, uppercase)
  - Date Created (with time)
  - Primary Diagnosis (from AI analysis)
  - Confidence Score (color-coded: green ≥80%, yellow ≥60%, default <60%)
  - Status (with color-coded chips)
  - Actions (View button)
- Clicking on a case navigates to `/pharmacy/diagnostics/cases/all?caseId={caseId}`
- "New Diagnosis" button to create new diagnostic cases
- Empty state message when no cases exist
- Loading and error states with proper UI feedback

**Data Source**:
- Uses `aiDiagnosticService.getPatientCases(patientId)` 
- Endpoint: `GET /api/diagnostics/patients/:patientId/history`
- React Query for data fetching and caching

### 2. Updated Patient Management Component
**File**: `frontend/src/components/PatientManagement.tsx`

**Changes**:
- Added import for `PatientDiagnosisList` component
- Added import for `BiotechIcon` from Material-UI
- Added "Diagnosis" to tab labels array (11th tab)
- Added BiotechIcon to tab icons array
- Added new TabPanel (index 10) for Diagnosis tab
- Tab positioned after "MTR Sessions" as requested

### 3. Status Mapping
The component handles the following statuses from the backend:
- `draft` → "Pending Review" (default color)
- `submitted` → "Submitted" (default color)
- `analyzing` → "Analyzing" (info/blue color)
- `completed` → "Completed" (success/green color)
- `failed` → "Failed" (error/red color)

### 4. Navigation Flow
When a user clicks on a diagnostic case:
1. Navigates to `/pharmacy/diagnostics/cases/all?caseId={caseId}`
2. The all cases page should filter/highlight the specific case
3. User can then view full details and perform actions:
   - Mark for Follow Up (status → `follow_up`)
   - Mark as Completed (status → `completed`)
   - Mark as Pending Review (status → `pending_review`)
   - Generate Referral (opens referral dialog, status → `referred`)

## Technical Details

### API Integration
- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/diagnostics/patients/:patientId/history`
- **Service**: `aiDiagnosticService.getPatientCases(patientId)`
- **Authentication**: Required (JWT token + License validation)
- **Feature Flag**: Requires `ai_diagnostics` feature

### Permissions
- Any pharmacist can view diagnostic cases for patients they have access to
- Status actions require opening the full case (handled in the all cases page)

### UI/UX Consistency
- Follows the same design pattern as `PatientMTRSessionsList`
- Uses Material-UI components for consistency
- Responsive design with proper spacing
- Color-coded status chips for quick visual identification
- Summary statistics cards at the top

## Files Modified
1. ✅ `frontend/src/components/PatientDiagnosisList.tsx` (NEW)
2. ✅ `frontend/src/components/PatientManagement.tsx` (UPDATED)

## No Breaking Changes
- ✅ No existing functionality was modified
- ✅ Only added new tab and component
- ✅ All existing tabs remain unchanged
- ✅ Uses existing API endpoints and services
- ✅ Follows established patterns and conventions

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Navigate to a patient's profile
- [ ] Click on the "Diagnosis" tab (11th tab, after MTR Sessions)
- [ ] Verify summary statistics display correctly
- [ ] Verify diagnostic cases table displays with all columns
- [ ] Click on a case to navigate to all cases page
- [ ] Verify "New Diagnosis" button navigates to case creation page
- [ ] Test with patient who has no diagnostic cases (empty state)
- [ ] Test loading state
- [ ] Test error state (disconnect network)

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)
- Add filtering/sorting capabilities to the table
- Add pagination for patients with many cases
- Add export functionality for diagnostic history
- Add quick status change actions (inline dropdowns)
- Add search functionality

## Notes
- The component uses React Query for efficient data fetching and caching
- Date formatting uses native JavaScript methods (`toLocaleDateString`, `toLocaleTimeString`)
- Status actions are handled in the full case view (not inline) as per requirements
- Any pharmacist can view and manage cases (no ownership restrictions)
