# Quick Actions Navigation Fix

## Issue
Quick Actions on the Super Admin Dashboard were navigating to non-existent routes, causing navigation failures.

## Root Cause
The Quick Actions were configured with placeholder routes (`/workspaces`, `/users`, `/reports`) that don't exist in the application's routing configuration.

## Solution
Updated the Quick Actions to use existing routes from the application:

### Before (Non-existent routes):
- `/workspaces` ❌
- `/users` ❌
- `/reports` ❌

### After (Existing routes):
- `/admin` ✅ - Super Admin control panel
- `/admin/feature-management` ✅ - Feature flags management
- `/reports-analytics` ✅ - Reports and analytics
- `/subscriptions` ✅ - Subscription management
- `/settings` ✅ - System settings

## Changes Made

**File**: `frontend/src/components/dashboard/SuperAdminQuickActions.tsx`

### Updated Quick Actions:

1. **Admin Panel** (was "Manage Workspaces")
   - Route: `/admin`
   - Description: Access super admin control panel
   - Icon: BusinessIcon

2. **Feature Management** (was "Manage Users")
   - Route: `/admin/feature-management`
   - Description: Manage system features and flags
   - Icon: SettingsIcon

3. **System Reports** (unchanged route name, fixed path)
   - Route: `/reports-analytics`
   - Description: Access detailed analytics and reports
   - Icon: AssessmentIcon

4. **Subscriptions** (unchanged)
   - Route: `/subscriptions`
   - Description: Manage billing and subscriptions
   - Icon: MonetizationOnIcon

5. **System Settings** (was "Access Workspace")
   - Route: `/settings`
   - Description: Configure system settings
   - Icon: LoginIcon

## Testing

After the fix, clicking each Quick Action should:
1. ✅ Navigate to the correct page
2. ✅ No console errors
3. ✅ Page loads successfully

### Test Each Action:
```
1. Click "Admin Panel" → Should go to /admin
2. Click "Feature Management" → Should go to /admin/feature-management
3. Click "System Reports" → Should go to /reports-analytics
4. Click "Subscriptions" → Should go to /subscriptions
5. Click "System Settings" → Should go to /settings
```

## Additional Notes

### Unrelated Errors in Console
The console also showed these errors (unrelated to Quick Actions):
- `Query error: ['feature-flags', 'list']` - 401 error
- `Query error: ['user', 'notifications', true]` - HTML response instead of JSON
- `Query error: ['patients', 'list']` - HTML response instead of JSON

These are separate issues related to:
1. Feature flags API authentication
2. API proxy configuration (returning HTML instead of JSON)

These should be addressed separately if they're causing issues.

## Verification

After saving the file:
1. Browser should auto-reload (Vite HMR)
2. Navigate to Super Admin Dashboard
3. Click each Quick Action
4. Verify navigation works
