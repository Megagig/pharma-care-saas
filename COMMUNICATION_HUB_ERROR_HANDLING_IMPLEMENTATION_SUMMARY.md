## Task 24: Build Comprehensive Error Handling and Recovery

### Overview

Successfully implemented a comprehensive error handling and recovery system for the Communication Hub that provides robust error boundaries, graceful offline degradation, detailed error reporting, user-friendly recovery suggestions, and automatic retry mechanisms.

### Components Implemented

#### 1. CommunicationErrorBoundary.tsx

**Purpose**: Communication-specific error boundary with advanced recovery features
**Key Features**:

- Catches JavaScript errors in communication components
- Provides contextual error analysis and severity assessment
- Offers recovery actions based on error type (retry, reconnect, reload)
- Displays offline indicators and connection status
- Includes development-mode error details
- Implements automatic retry with exponential backoff
- Tracks retry attempts and error frequency

**Error Types Handled**:

- Network errors (connection lost, timeouts)
- WebSocket errors (real-time connection issues)
- Chunk loading errors (code splitting failures)
- Authentication errors (session expired)
- Permission errors (access denied)
- Generic component errors

#### 2. CommunicationErrorService.ts

**Purpose**: Centralized error analysis, classification, and handling service
**Key Features**:

- Severity classification (low, medium, high, critical)
- Recovery action suggestions with handlers
- Error history tracking and statistics
- Automatic retry mechanisms with configurable delays
- Performance metrics integration
- Error listener system for real-time notifications

**Error Classification**:

- `connection_lost`: Network connectivity issues
