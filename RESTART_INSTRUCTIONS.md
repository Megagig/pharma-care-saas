# ✅ Migration Complete! Now Restart Your Server

## Step 1: Stop Your Backend Server
In your backend terminal, press `Ctrl+C` to stop the server.

## Step 2: Restart the Backend
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Step 3: Test the Implementation

### Test as a Regular User (Pharmacist/Owner):

1. **Login to your application**
2. **Navigate to any of these modules:**
   - Clinical Notes (`/notes`)
   - Medication Therapy Review (`/pharmacy/medication-therapy`)
   - Clinical Interventions (`/pharmacy/clinical-interventions`)
   - AI Diagnostics (`/pharmacy/diagnostics`)
   - Clinical Decision Support (`/pharmacy/decision-support`)

3. **You should see a license verification modal** with:
   - Warning icon
   - "License Verification Required" message
   - "Upload License" button

4. **Click "Upload License"** and you'll be taken to `/license` route

5. **Fill out the form:**
   - License Number (e.g., PCN-123456)
   - Expiration Date (select a future date)
   - Pharmacy School (e.g., University of Lagos)
   - Year of Graduation (optional, e.g., 2020)
   - Upload a PDF or image file (max 5MB)

6. **Submit the form** and you should see:
   - Success message
   - Status changes to "pending"
   - "Under Review" message

### Test as Super Admin:

1. **Login as super admin**
2. **Navigate to SaaS Settings** (`/saas-settings`)
3. **Look for the "License Verification" tab** (should be after "Tenant Management")
4. **Click on it** to see:
   - List of all pending licenses
   - User details
   - License information
   - Document preview option
   - Approve/Reject buttons

5. **Click "View" on a license** to:
   - Preview the uploaded document
   - See all license details
   - Approve or reject with reason

## 🔍 If You Still Don't See the Changes:

### Clear Browser Cache:
1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Application/Storage tab
3. Clear all storage
4. Or use Incognito/Private mode

### Verify Your User Role:
Your user must be one of these roles to see the license requirement:
- `pharmacist`
- `intern_pharmacist`
- `owner`

If you're logged in as `super_admin` or `pharmacy_team`, you won't see the license modal.

### Check Browser Console:
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Look for any errors
4. Check Network tab for failed API calls

## 📊 What Changed:

### Database:
✅ 7 users updated with new fields:
- `pharmacySchool` (undefined initially)
- `yearOfGraduation` (undefined initially)

### Backend:
✅ User model enhanced
✅ License controller updated
✅ Admin controller updated
✅ All routes registered

### Frontend:
✅ License upload form enhanced
✅ Protected routes updated
✅ Admin interface created
✅ RBAC hook updated

## 🎯 Expected Behavior:

### For Pharmacist/Intern Pharmacist/Owner:
- ❌ Cannot access protected modules without approved license
- ✅ See license verification modal
- ✅ Can upload license
- ✅ Can check status at `/license`

### For Super Admin:
- ✅ New "License Verification" tab in SaaS Settings
- ✅ Can view all pending licenses
- ✅ Can approve/reject licenses
- ✅ Can preview documents

### For Other Roles (pharmacy_team):
- ✅ Can access all modules without license
- ✅ No license verification required

## 🐛 Troubleshooting:

### Issue: No license modal appears
**Check:**
1. User role is correct (pharmacist/intern_pharmacist/owner)
2. Backend is running with latest build
3. Browser cache is cleared
4. No console errors

### Issue: Can't see License Verification tab
**Check:**
1. Logged in as super_admin
2. In SaaS Settings page (`/saas-settings`)
3. Scroll through tabs to find it

### Issue: Upload fails
**Check:**
1. File is PDF or image (JPEG, PNG, WebP)
2. File size is under 5MB
3. All required fields are filled
4. Backend logs for errors

## 📝 Quick Test:

### Create a Test Pharmacist User:
If you don't have a pharmacist user, you can update an existing user in MongoDB:

```javascript
// In MongoDB Compass or Shell
db.users.updateOne(
  { email: "your-test-email@example.com" },
  { 
    $set: { 
      role: "pharmacist",
      licenseStatus: "pending"
    }
  }
)
```

Then login with that user and try accessing Clinical Notes.
