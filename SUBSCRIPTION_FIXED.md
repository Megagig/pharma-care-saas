# ✅ Subscription Issue FIXED!

## The Root Cause

There was a **field name mismatch** between models:
- **User model**: Uses `workplaceId` (with an 'e')
- **Subscription model**: Uses `workspaceId` (without the 'e')

The subscription controller was checking `user.workplaceId` but querying with `workspaceId`, which caused the mismatch.

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Activation Script (`activateSubscription.ts`)
- Now correctly uses `user.workplaceId` to get the workplace ID
- Creates subscriptions with the correct `workspaceId` field
- Removed the old `userId` field from subscription creation

### 2. Subscription Controller (`subscriptionController.ts`)
- Fixed `getCurrentSubscription()` method
- Fixed `getSubscriptionStatus()` method
- Both now correctly map: `user.workplaceId` → `Subscription.workspaceId`

## What You Need to Do Now

1. **Restart your backend server**:
   ```bash
   # In the backend directory
   # Stop with Ctrl+C, then:
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Hard refresh your frontend** (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)

3. **Test it** - Your Pro subscription should now work!
