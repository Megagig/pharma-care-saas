- **Validation**: Custom validation functions (avoiding yup dependency issues)
- **State Management**: Local component state with hooks

### UI Components

- **Framework**: Material-UI (MUI) for consistent design
- **Layout**: Responsive Grid system
- **Icons**: MUI Icons for visual elements

### Data Flow

- **Props Interface**: Flexible props for different use cases
- **Callbacks**: onSave and onCancel for parent component integration
- **State Lifting**: Form data passed to parent on save

### Accessibility

- **Labels**: Proper labeling for all form fields
- **Error Messages**: Screen reader friendly error descriptions
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard accessibility
- **Focus Management**: Logical tab order

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

```tsx
import SimpleClinicalNoteForm from './components/SimpleClinicalNoteForm';

<SimpleClinicalNoteForm
  onSave={(noteData) => console.log('Note saved:', noteData)}
  onCancel={() => console.log('Form cancelled')}
/>;
```

### With Patient Pre-population

```tsx
<SimpleClinicalNoteForm
  patientId="PAT123"
  onSave={handleSave}
  onCancel={handleCancel}
/>
```

### Edit Mode

```tsx
<SimpleClinicalNoteForm
  noteId="NOTE456"
  onSave={handleUpdate}
  onCancel={handleCancel}
/>
```

### Readonly Mode

```tsx
<SimpleClinicalNoteForm
  noteId="NOTE456"
  readonly={true}
  onCancel={handleClose}
/>
```

## Integration Points

### With Clinical Notes Dashboard

- Form can be opened from dashboard for creating new notes
- Edit mode accessible from note list actions

### With Patient Management

- Patient context can be passed to pre-populate patient field
- Integration with patient selection components

### With Backend API
