# 🎯 What To Do Now - Simple Steps

## ✅ Migration Complete!
Your database has been updated successfully (7 users updated).

## 🚀 To See the Changes:

### Step 1: Restart Backend (REQUIRED)
```bash
# In your backend terminal, press Ctrl+C to stop
# Then run:
npm run dev
```

### Step 2: Clear Browser Cache
- Press `Ctrl+Shift+Delete` (or `Cmd+Shift+Delete` on Mac)
- Select "Cached images and files"
- Click "Clear data"
- **OR** just use Incognito/Private mode

### Step 3: Test It!

#### Option A: Test as Regular User
1. Login with a user that has role: `pharmacist`, `intern_pharmacist`, or `owner`
2. Click on "Clinical Notes" in the sidebar
3. **You should see a modal** saying "License Verification Required"
4. Click "Upload License" button
5. Fill the form and upload a document

#### Option B: Test as Super Admin
1. Login as super admin
2. Go to "SaaS Settings"
3. Look for "License Verification" tab (new tab added)
4. Click it to see the license management interface

## 🔍 What If I Don't See Any Changes?

### Check 1: Is Backend Running with New Code?
```bash
# Stop backend (Ctrl+C)
# Rebuild
npm run build
# Start again
npm run dev
```

### Check 2: What's My User Role?
The license verification only shows for these roles:
- ✅ pharmacist
- ✅ intern_pharmacist
- ✅ owner
- ❌ super_admin (no license needed)
- ❌ pharmacy_team (no license needed)

To check your role, look at the backend logs when you login, or check in MongoDB.

### Check 3: Clear Everything
```bash
# In browser console (F12)
localStorage.clear()
sessionStorage.clear()
location.reload(true)
```
