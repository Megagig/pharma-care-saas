### SOAP Note Structure

#### Subjective Section

Document what the patient tells you:

the new blood pressure medication 3 days ago. States symptoms are
worse in the morning and improve throughout the day. No vomiting or
severe headaches. Patient is concerned about continuing the medication.
```

#### Objective Section

Record measurable and observable data:

- Vital signs
- Physical examination findings
- Laboratory results
- Medication adherence assessment

**Example:**

```
BP: 142/88 mmHg (down from 160/95 at last visit)
HR: 68 bpm, regular
Patient appears alert and oriented
Medication adherence: 90% based on pill count
No signs of dehydration or orthostatic hypotension
```

#### Assessment Section

Your clinical judgment and analysis:

- Primary and secondary diagnoses
- Medication-related problems identified
- Risk factors and concerns
- Progress toward treatment goals

**Example:**

```
1. Hypertension - improving with current therapy
2. Medication-induced nausea - likely related to lisinopril
3. Good medication adherence despite side effects
4. Patient education needed on timing of medication administration
```

#### Plan Section

Your treatment recommendations and next steps:

- Medication adjustments

**Example:**

```
1. Continue lisinopril 10mg daily but take with food to reduce nausea
