2. **Verify Consent**: Confirm patient consent for AI analysis
3. **Submit Request**: Click "Request AI Analysis"
4. **Monitor Progress**: Track analysis progress in real-time

### Understanding AI Results

#### Differential Diagnoses

AI provides ranked list of possible diagnoses:

```
Example Output:
1. Acute Coronary Syndrome (75% confidence)
   - Reasoning: Chest pain + elevated troponin + risk factors
   - ICD-10: I20.9
   - SNOMED: 394659003

2. Unstable Angina (60% confidence)
   - Reasoning: Chest pain pattern consistent with cardiac origin
   - ICD-10: I20.0
   - SNOMED: 25106000

3. Anxiety Disorder (25% confidence)
   - Reasoning: Symptoms could be anxiety-related
   - ICD-10: F41.9
   - SNOMED: 48694002
```

#### Confidence Scoring

- **High Confidence (>80%)**: Strong evidence supports diagnosis
- **Moderate Confidence (50-80%)**: Reasonable likelihood, consider additional testing
- **Low Confidence (<50%)**: Uncertain diagnosis, requires further evaluation

#### Red Flags and Alerts

The AI identifies critical findings requiring immediate attention:

```
🚨 HIGH PRIORITY ALERTS:
- Elevated troponin suggests myocardial injury
- Chest pain with cardiac risk factors
- Recommend immediate cardiology referral

⚠️ MODERATE ALERTS:
- Blood pressure elevation requires monitoring
- Consider medication adjustment

ℹ️ INFORMATIONAL:
- Patient age increases cardiovascular risk
- Family history of heart disease noted
```

### Suggested Tests and Interventions

#### Recommended Lab Tests

AI suggests additional tests based on clinical presentation:

- Priority level (urgent, routine, optional)
- Clinical rationale for each test
- Expected impact on diagnosis
- Cost-effectiveness considerations

#### Medication Recommendations

When appropriate, AI may suggest:

- Therapeutic interventions within pharmacist scope
- Medication therapy management opportunities
- Drug interaction considerations
- Dosing recommendations based on patient factors

## Drug Interaction Checking

### Automatic Screening

The system automatically checks for:

- Drug-drug interactions
