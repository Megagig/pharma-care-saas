A: Order details cannot be modified after creation. You can update status and add notes. For significant changes, create a new order.

**Q: How long are orders stored in the system?**
A: Orders are stored indefinitely for compliance purposes. Archived orders remain searchable but may have limited functionality.

**Q: Can patients access their lab orders?**
A: Patients can view their results through the patient portal once results are completed and released by the pharmacist.

### Technical Questions

**Q: What browsers are supported?**
A: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge (latest versions). Mobile browsers are also supported.

**Q: Can I use the system offline?**
A: No, the system requires internet connectivity for all functions including PDF generation and AI interpretation.

**Q: How secure is patient data?**
A: All data is encrypted and HIPAA compliant. Access is logged and monitored for security.

### Clinical Questions

**Q: How accurate is the AI interpretation?**
A: AI provides decision support with high accuracy, but clinical judgment is always required. Use AI as a tool, not a replacement for clinical expertise.

**Q: Can I override AI recommendations?**
A: Yes, you have full control over clinical decisions. Document your reasoning when deviating from AI recommendations.

**Q: What if AI flags something I disagree with?**
A: Review the AI reasoning, consider additional factors, and make your clinical decision. Document your assessment.

### Workflow Questions

**Q: Can multiple pharmacists work on the same order?**
A: Yes, but only one pharmacist can enter results. Status updates and notes can be added by any authorized user.

**Q: What happens if a patient doesn't return for results?**
A: Orders remain in "sample_collected" or "result_awaited" status. Follow up with patients according to your pharmacy's policy.

**Q: Can I create orders for walk-in patients?**
A: Yes, but ensure the patient exists in your system first. Create patient profile if needed before creating orders.
