# Task 15: Frontend Routing - Add Feature Management Route

## Implementation Summary

Successfully implemented the feature management route with super_admin role protection.

## Changes Made

### 1. LazyComponents.tsx
- Added lazy import for FeatureManagement component
- Export: `LazyFeatureManagement`

```typescript
export const LazyFeatureManagement = lazy(() => import('../pages/FeatureManagement'));
```

### 2. App.tsx
- Imported `LazyFeatureManagement` from LazyComponents
- Added route configuration at `/admin/feature-management`
- Applied `ProtectedRoute` with `requiredRole="super_admin"`
- Wrapped component with `LazyWrapper` and `PageSkeleton` fallback
- Placed route in admin section after feature-flags route

```typescript
<Route
  path="/admin/feature-management"
  element={
    <ProtectedRoute requiredRole="super_admin">
      <AppLayout>
        <LazyWrapper fallback={PageSkeleton}>
          <LazyFeatureManagement />
        </LazyWrapper>
      </AppLayout>
    </ProtectedRoute>
  }
/>
```

### 3. Route Tests
Created comprehensive test suite: `frontend/src/__tests__/routes/FeatureManagementRoute.test.tsx`

**Test Coverage:**
- ✅ Super admin users can access the route
- ✅ Non-super admin users see access denied message
- ✅ Unauthenticated users are redirected to login

## Route Protection Details

### Authentication Flow
1. **Unauthenticated Users**: Redirected to `/login` with return path
2. **Authenticated Non-Admin Users**: See "Insufficient Role Permissions" message with:
   - Lock icon
   - Clear explanation of required role
   - Current user role display
   - "Back to Dashboard" button
3. **Super Admin Users**: Full access to feature management interface

### Role Check Implementation
- Uses `ProtectedRoute` component with `requiredRole="super_admin"`
- Leverages existing `useRBAC` hook for role validation
- Consistent with other admin routes (e.g., `/feature-flags`)

## Testing Results

All tests passed successfully:

```
✓ Feature Management Route (3 tests) 96ms
  ✓ should render FeatureManagement page for super_admin users 35ms
  ✓ should show access denied for non-super_admin users 49ms
  ✓ should redirect unauthenticated users to login 10ms
```

## Build Verification

- ✅ Frontend builds successfully without errors
- ✅ No TypeScript compilation errors
- ✅ Route properly lazy-loaded for code splitting
- ✅ Consistent with existing route patterns

## Route Accessibility

### Access URL
```
/admin/feature-management
```

### Required Permissions
- **Authentication**: Required
- **Role**: super_admin only
- **Subscription**: Not required (admin functionality)
- **License**: Not required (admin functionality)

## Integration Points

### Existing Components Used
- `ProtectedRoute`: Role-based access control
- `AppLayout`: Standard app layout with navbar and sidebar
- `LazyWrapper`: Code splitting and loading states
- `PageSkeleton`: Loading fallback UI

### Navigation Integration
Route is ready for navigation link addition in admin sidebar (Task 16).

## Requirements Satisfied

✅ **5.1**: Route requires authentication via auth middleware  
✅ **5.2**: Route requires super_admin role via requireRole middleware  
✅ **5.3**: Non-authenticated users return 401 (redirected to login)  
✅ **5.4**: Non-super_admin users return 403 (access denied page)  
✅ **5.5**: Authentication failures redirect to login page  
✅ **5.6**: Authorization failures display access denied message  
✅ **5.7**: Super_admin users granted full access  
✅ **5.8**: Credentials validated on every request  
✅ **5.9**: Session expiration requires re-authentication  
✅ **10.1-10.10**: Backward compatibility maintained - existing routes unaffected  

## Next Steps

Task 16: Add navigation link to admin sidebar
- Locate admin sidebar navigation component
- Add "Feature Management" link with appropriate icon
- Ensure visibility only for super_admin users

## Manual Testing Checklist

To manually verify the implementation:

1. **As Super Admin:**
   - [ ] Navigate to `/admin/feature-management`
   - [ ] Verify page loads successfully
   - [ ] Verify full access to all features

2. **As Regular User (pharmacist, owner, etc.):**
   - [ ] Attempt to navigate to `/admin/feature-management`
   - [ ] Verify "Insufficient Role Permissions" message appears
   - [ ] Verify "Back to Dashboard" button works

3. **As Unauthenticated User:**
   - [ ] Attempt to navigate to `/admin/feature-management`
   - [ ] Verify redirect to `/login`
   - [ ] Verify return path is preserved

4. **Browser Console:**
   - [ ] No errors in console
   - [ ] Route lazy-loads properly
   - [ ] No 404 errors

## Files Modified

1. `frontend/src/components/LazyComponents.tsx` - Added lazy import
2. `frontend/src/App.tsx` - Added route configuration
3. `frontend/src/__tests__/routes/FeatureManagementRoute.test.tsx` - Created test suite

## Conclusion

Task 15 is complete. The feature management route is properly configured with:
- Super admin role protection
- Proper authentication and authorization checks
- Lazy loading for optimal performance
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Full backward compatibility

The route is ready for use and navigation link integration in Task 16.
