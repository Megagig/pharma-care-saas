## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Test Framework
- **Framework**: Playwright
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Test Runner**: Playwright Test Runner
- **Browsers**: Chromium, Firefox, WebKit

### Key Features
1. **Reusable Helper Functions**
   - `loginAsSuperAdmin(page)` - Authenticate as super admin
   - `loginAsRegularUser(page)` - Authenticate as regular user
   - `navigateToFeatureManagement(page)` - Navigate to feature page
   - `createFeature(page, data)` - Create feature through UI

2. **Robust Selectors**
   - Semantic selectors (role, text, aria-labels)
   - Fallback selectors for flexibility
   - Avoids brittle CSS selectors

3. **Proper Waits**
   - `waitForSelector` for dynamic content
   - `waitForURL` for navigation
   - `waitForLoadState` for network idle
   - No hard-coded timeouts

4. **Error Handling**
   - Network failure simulation
   - Validation error testing
   - Authorization failure testing
   - Retry mechanisms

5. **Responsive Testing**
   - Mobile viewport (320px, 375px)
   - Tablet viewport (768px)
   - Desktop viewport (1024px+)
   - Horizontal scroll verification
