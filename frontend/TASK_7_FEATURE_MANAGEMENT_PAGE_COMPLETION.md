## Requirements Coverage

All requirements from task 7 have been implemented:

- ✅ 9.10: Responsive layout for mobile, tablet, and desktop
- ✅ 9.11: Form validation and error display
- ✅ 9.12: Toast notifications for success/error messages

## Integration Points

### Service Layer Integration
- Uses `featureFlagService.getFeatureFlags()` to fetch all features
- Uses `featureFlagService.createFeatureFlag()` to create new features
- Uses `featureFlagService.updateFeatureFlag()` to update existing features
- Uses `featureFlagService.deleteFeatureFlag()` to delete features

### UI Library Integration
- Uses MUI v5 components consistently with the rest of the application
- Uses react-hot-toast for notifications (consistent with other pages)
- Follows existing patterns from PricingManagement and SaasSettings pages

## Next Steps

The following tasks are ready to be implemented:

1. **Task 8**: Implement feature creation form (already included in this implementation)
2. **Task 9**: Implement feature list display (already included in this implementation)
3. **Task 10**: Implement tier feature matrix component (placeholder added)
4. **Task 11**: Add page header and navigation (header implemented, routing needed)
5. **Task 12**: Implement form reset functionality (already implemented)
6. **Task 13**: Add loading and error states (already implemented)
7. **Task 14**: Implement responsive design (already implemented)
8. **Task 15**: Add feature management route (needs router configuration)
9. **Task 16**: Add link to admin sidebar (needs navigation update)

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Manual Testing**:
   - Test creating a new feature with all fields
   - Test editing an existing feature
   - Test deleting a feature with confirmation
   - Test form validation (empty required fields)
   - Test responsive behavior on different screen sizes
   - Test tab switching

2. **Unit Testing** (Task 17):
   - Component rendering tests
   - Form submission tests
   - Edit/delete functionality tests
   - Service method mocking

3. **E2E Testing** (Task 18):
   - Complete workflow testing
   - Authorization testing
   - Cross-browser testing

## Notes

- The component follows MUI v5 patterns used throughout the application
- Toast notifications use react-hot-toast (consistent with existing pages)
- The Tier Management tab shows a placeholder - the matrix will be implemented in task 10
- Form validation is basic - can be enhanced with more sophisticated validation in future iterations
- The component is ready for integration once routing is configured
