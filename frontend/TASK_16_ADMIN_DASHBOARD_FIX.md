# Task 16: Additional Fix - Admin Dashboard Error

## 🐛 Secondary Issue Discovered

After fixing the main issue with the Feature Management link visibility, a secondary error was discovered in the Admin Dashboard:

**Error**: `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'replace')`

## 🔍 Root Cause

The error occurred in `AdminDashboard.tsx` at line 698:

```typescript
<Chip
  label={user.systemRole.replace('_', ' ')}  // ← Error: systemRole is undefined
  color={getRoleColor(user.systemRole)}
  size="small"
/>
```

Some users in the database don't have a `systemRole` property, causing the `.replace()` method to fail when trying to access it on `undefined`.

## ✅ Solution

Added null-safety checks to handle undefined `systemRole`:

```typescript
<Chip
  label={(user.systemRole || 'unknown').replace('_', ' ')}  // ← Safe: defaults to 'unknown'
  color={getRoleColor(user.systemRole || 'unknown')}
  size="small"
/>
```

## 📝 File Modified

**`frontend/src/components/admin/AdminDashboard.tsx`**
- Line ~698-700
- Added `|| 'unknown'` fallback for undefined `systemRole`

## 🧪 Testing

### Before Fix
- ❌ Admin Dashboard crashes with "Cannot read properties of undefined"
- ❌ User table fails to render
- ❌ Console shows error

### After Fix
- ✅ Admin Dashboard loads successfully
- ✅ User table renders correctly
- ✅ Users without systemRole show as "unknown"
- ✅ No console errors

## 🎯 Impact

This fix ensures the Admin Dashboard is resilient to data inconsistencies:
- Handles users without `systemRole` property
- Displays "unknown" for undefined roles
- Prevents application crashes
- Improves error handling

## 📊 Related to Task 16

While this error was discovered during Task 16 testing, it's actually a pre-existing issue in the Admin Dashboard that was exposed when testing with the super_admin user. The fix is independent of the Feature Management link implementation.
