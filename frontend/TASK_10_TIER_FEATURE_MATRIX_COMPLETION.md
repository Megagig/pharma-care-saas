# Task 10: Tier Feature Matrix Component - Implementation Complete

## Overview
Successfully implemented the TierFeatureMatrix sub-component for the Feature Management page, providing a visual matrix interface for managing feature-tier mappings.

## Implementation Details

### Component Structure
Created `TierFeatureMatrix` as a sub-component within `FeatureManagement.tsx` with the following features:

1. **Props Interface**
   - `features: FeatureFlag[]` - Array of features to display
   - `onUpdate: () => void` - Callback to refresh feature list after updates

2. **State Management**
   - `updating: string | null` - Tracks which feature-tier combination is being updated
   - Uses composite key format: `${tier}-${featureKey}`

3. **Core Functionality**
   - `updateTierFeature()` - Async function to add/remove features from tiers
   - `capitalizeFirstLetter()` - Helper to format tier names for display

### UI Components Used
- **Card** with CardHeader and CardContent for container
- **Table** element with proper semantic structure
- **Switch** components for toggling feature-tier access
- **CircularProgress** for loading states during updates
- **Typography** for feature names and keys
- **Alert** for empty state message

### Table Structure

#### Header Row
- First column: "Feature" label
- Subsequent columns: Capitalized tier names (Free trial, Basic, Pro, Pharmily, Network, Enterprise)

#### Body Rows
Each row contains:
- **First column**: 
  - Feature name (bold)
  - Feature key (monospace, secondary color)
- **Tier columns**: 
  - Switch component (checked if tier is in allowedTiers)
  - CircularProgress spinner during updates

### Key Features Implemented

✅ **Proper Table Structure**
- Semantic HTML table with thead and tbody
- Styled with MUI Box component for consistent theming
- Border styling and padding for readability

✅ **Dynamic Switch States**
- Checked state based on `feature.allowedTiers.includes(tier)`
- Disabled during updates to prevent race conditions
- Individual loading indicators per switch

✅ **Async Update Function**
- Calls `featureFlagService.updateTierFeatures(tier, [featureKey], action)`
- Action determined by switch state: 'add' or 'remove'
- Proper error handling with try-catch

✅ **Toast Notifications**
- Success: "Feature enabled/disabled for {tier} tier"
- Error: Displays error message from exception

✅ **Callback Integration**
- Calls `onUpdate()` after successful update
- Refreshes feature list to reflect changes immediately

✅ **Mobile Responsiveness**
- Outer Box with `overflowX: 'auto'` for horizontal scrolling
- Table with `minWidth: '600px'` to maintain readability
- Column min-widths to prevent cramping

✅ **Empty State Handling**
- Shows informative Alert when no features exist
- Guides user to create features in Features tab first

### Integration

The component is integrated into the Tier Management tab:
```tsx
<TabPanel value={activeTab} index={1}>
  <TierFeatureMatrix features={features} onUpdate={fetchFeatures} />
</TabPanel>
```

### Requirements Satisfied

- ✅ Map AVAILABLE_TIERS to create column headers with capitalized names
- ✅ Add tbody with rows for each feature
- ✅ Display feature name and key in first column
- ✅ Map AVAILABLE_TIERS to create cells with Switch components
- ✅ Set Switch checked state based on feature.allowedTiers.includes(tier)
- ✅ Implement updateTierFeature async function
- ✅ Call updateTierFeatures service method with tier, featureKey, and action
- ✅ Show success toast with tier and action details
- ✅ Call onUpdate callback to refresh feature list
- ✅ Show error toast on failure
- ✅ Add overflow-x-auto wrapper for horizontal scrolling on mobile
