# User Management Reorganization

## 🎯 Problem Identified

**Issue**: User Management was in the ACCOUNT section and visible to all users, but:
1. Most actions are performed by super_admin
2. Workspace owners had no clear way to manage their team members

## ✅ Solution Implemented

Created **two separate navigation items** for different user roles:

### 1. **User Management** (Super Admin)
- Location: ADMINISTRATION section
- Access: Super admin only
- Purpose: System-wide user management
- Path: `/user-management`

### 2. **Team Members** (Workspace Owners)
- Location: ACCOUNT section  
- Access: Workspace owners (`pharmacy_outlet` role)
- Purpose: Manage team members within their workspace
- Path: `/user-management` (same page, different permissions)

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### File Modified: `frontend/src/components/Sidebar.tsx`

#### 1. Added User Management to adminItems:
```typescript
const adminItems = [
  {
    name: 'Admin Panel',
    path: '/admin',
    icon: AdminIcon,
    show: hasRole('super_admin'),
  },
  {
    name: 'Feature Management',
    path: '/admin/feature-management',
    icon: FlagIcon,
    show: hasRole('super_admin'),
  },
  {
    name: 'Feature Flags',
    path: '/feature-flags',
    icon: SettingsIcon,
    show: hasRole('super_admin') && hasFeature('feature_flag_management'),
  },
  {
    name: 'Saas Settings',
    path: '/saas-settings',
    icon: SettingsIcon,
    show: hasRole('super_admin'),
  },
  {
    name: 'User Management',           // ← ADDED
    path: '/user-management',
    icon: SupervisorAccountIcon,
    show: hasRole('super_admin'),      // ← Super admin only
  },
];
```

#### 2. Updated settingsItems with Team Members:
```typescript
const settingsItems = [
  {
    name: 'Team Members',              // ← CHANGED from "User Management"
    path: '/user-management',
    icon: SupervisorAccountIcon,
    show: hasRole('owner') || hasRole('pharmacy_outlet'), // ← Workspace owners
  },
  {
    name: 'License Verification',
    path: '/license',
    icon: LicenseIcon,
    show: requiresLicense(),
    // ...
  },
  // ... rest of items
];
```

## 🔐 Access Control Logic

### User Management (Admin)
```typescript
show: hasRole('super_admin')
```
- **Who sees it**: Super admins only
- **What they can do**: Manage all users across the entire system
- **Use case**: System administration, user approval, role changes

### Team Members (Workspace Owners)
```typescript
show: hasRole('owner') || hasRole('pharmacy_outlet')
```
- **Who sees it**: Workspace owners
- **What they can do**: Manage users within their workspace
- **Use case**: Add team members, assign roles, manage workspace access

## 📊 Benefits

### For Super Admins
✅ Clear separation of admin functions  
✅ All admin tools in one section  
✅ System-wide user management access  
✅ Better organization

### For Workspace Owners
✅ Clear "Team Members" label (more intuitive)  
✅ Easy access to manage their team  
✅ Appropriate permissions for workspace management  
✅ Not confused with system-wide admin functions

### For Regular Users
✅ Cleaner interface (no inaccessible links)  
✅ Less confusion about permissions  
✅ Focus on relevant features  
✅ Better user experience

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### Super Admin Testing
- [ ] Login as super_admin
- [ ] Verify ADMINISTRATION section visible
- [ ] Verify "User Management" appears in ADMINISTRATION
- [ ] Click "User Management" → Navigate to `/user-management`
- [ ] Verify full system-wide user management access
- [ ] Verify "Team Members" does NOT appear in ACCOUNT

### Workspace Owner Testing
- [ ] Login as pharmacy_outlet (workspace owner)
- [ ] Verify ADMINISTRATION section does NOT appear
- [ ] Verify "Team Members" appears in ACCOUNT section
- [ ] Click "Team Members" → Navigate to `/user-management`
- [ ] Verify workspace-scoped user management
- [ ] Can manage users within their workspace

### Regular User Testing
- [ ] Login as pharmacist or pharmacy_team
- [ ] Verify ADMINISTRATION section does NOT appear
- [ ] Verify "User Management" does NOT appear
- [ ] Verify "Team Members" does NOT appear
- [ ] Verify clean ACCOUNT section with relevant items

## 🔄 Migration Notes

### No Breaking Changes
- ✅ Same route path (`/user-management`)
- ✅ Same component (permissions handled in component)
- ✅ Backward compatible
- ✅ No database changes needed

### User Impact
- **Super Admins**: Link moved to ADMINISTRATION (more logical)
- **Workspace Owners**: New "Team Members" link (clearer purpose)
- **Regular Users**: Link removed (was never accessible anyway)

## 💡 Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Separate Components**: Create distinct components for:
   - System-wide user management (super_admin)
   - Workspace team management (owners)

2. **Different Routes**: Consider separate routes:
   - `/admin/users` - System-wide management
   - `/team` or `/workspace/members` - Team management

3. **Enhanced Permissions**: Add more granular permissions:
   - View team members
   - Invite team members
   - Remove team members
   - Change team member roles

4. **Workspace Context**: Add workspace selector for super_admins to manage specific workspaces
