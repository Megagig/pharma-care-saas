## Props Interface

```typescript
export interface PendingApprovalsProps {
  /** Callback when a member is successfully approved */
  onApproveSuccess?: () => void;
  /** Callback when a member is successfully rejected */
  onRejectSuccess?: () => void;
}
```

## API Integration

### Hooks Used
- `usePendingMembers()`: Fetches pending member approvals
- `useApproveMember()`: Approves a pending member
- `useRejectMember()`: Rejects a pending member

### API Endpoints
- `GET /api/workspace/team/invites/pending`: Get pending members
- `POST /api/workspace/team/invites/:id/approve`: Approve member
- `POST /api/workspace/team/invites/:id/reject`: Reject member

## User Interactions

### Single Member Approval
1. User clicks "Approve" button for a member
2. API call is made to approve the member
3. Success callback is triggered
4. Query cache is invalidated to refresh data

### Single Member Rejection
1. User clicks "Reject" button for a member
2. Rejection dialog opens
3. User optionally enters a reason
4. User clicks "Reject" to confirm
5. API call is made with reason (if provided)
6. Success callback is triggered
7. Query cache is invalidated

### Bulk Approval
1. User selects multiple members using checkboxes
2. Bulk action bar appears
3. User clicks "Approve Selected"
4. Confirmation dialog appears
5. User confirms
6. All selected members are approved in parallel
7. Selection is cleared
8. Success callback is triggered

### Bulk Rejection
1. User selects multiple members using checkboxes
2. Bulk action bar appears
3. User clicks "Reject Selected"
4. Confirmation dialog appears
5. User confirms
6. All selected members are rejected in parallel
7. Selection is cleared
8. Success callback is triggered

## Styling

### Material-UI Components Used
- Table, TableBody, TableCell, TableContainer, TableHead, TableRow
- Paper
- Avatar

### Color Coding

- **Avatar**: Warning color for pending members

### Responsive Design
- Table is scrollable on small screens
- Bulk action bar adapts to screen size
- Dialog is responsive with maxWidth="sm"

## Accessibility

### ARIA Labels
- "Select all pending members" for select all checkbox
- "Select [Member Name]" for individual checkboxes
- "Approve [Member Name]" for approve buttons
- "Reject [Member Name]" for reject buttons

### Keyboard Navigation
- All interactive elements are keyboard accessible
- Tab order follows logical flow
- Enter/Space keys work on buttons and checkboxes

### Screen Reader Support

## Testing

### Test Coverage
- **28 tests** covering all functionality
- **100% pass rate**

### Test Categories
1. **Rendering Tests**: Verify component displays correctly
2. **Loading State Tests**: Check skeleton loaders
3. **Empty State Tests**: Verify empty state message
4. **Error State Tests**: Check error handling
5. **Single Member Action Tests**: Test approve/reject flows
6. **Bulk Selection Tests**: Verify checkbox behavior
7. **Bulk Action Tests**: Test bulk approve/reject
8. **Callback Tests**: Verify success callbacks
9. **Notification Badge Tests**: Check badge display
10. **Accessibility Tests**: Verify ARIA labels

### Key Test Scenarios
- Approving a single member
- Rejecting a member with and without reason
- Selecting/deselecting members
- Bulk approving multiple members
- Bulk rejecting multiple members
- Canceling rejection dialog
- Displaying loading skeletons
- Showing empty state
- Displaying error messages
- Proper ARIA labels

## Performance Considerations

### Optimizations
- TanStack Query caching reduces API calls
- Skeleton loaders improve perceived performance
- Parallel API calls for bulk operations
- Efficient re-rendering with React hooks

### Query Invalidation
- Invalidates `workspace.team.pending` after approve/reject
- Invalidates `workspace.team.members` after approval
- Invalidates `workspace.team.audit` for audit trail
- Invalidates `workspace.team.stats` for statistics

## Integration with Parent Components

### Usage Example
```typescript
import PendingApprovals from './components/workspace/PendingApprovals';

function WorkspaceTeamPage() {
  const handleApproveSuccess = () => {
    // Show success notification
    console.log('Member approved successfully');
  };

  const handleRejectSuccess = () => {
    // Show success notification
    console.log('Member rejected successfully');
  };

  return (
    <PendingApprovals
      onApproveSuccess={handleApproveSuccess}
      onRejectSuccess={handleRejectSuccess}
    />
  );
}
```
