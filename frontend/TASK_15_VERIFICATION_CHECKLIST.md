# Task 15 Verification Checklist

## ✅ Implementation Complete

### Code Changes Verified

#### 1. LazyComponents.tsx
- [x] `LazyFeatureManagement` export added
- [x] Follows existing lazy loading pattern
- [x] Imports from correct path: `../pages/FeatureManagement`

#### 2. App.tsx
- [x] `LazyFeatureManagement` imported from LazyComponents
- [x] Route added at `/admin/feature-management`
- [x] `ProtectedRoute` wrapper with `requiredRole="super_admin"`
- [x] `AppLayout` wrapper for consistent layout
- [x] `LazyWrapper` with `PageSkeleton` fallback
- [x] Route placed in logical location (after feature-flags)

#### 3. Tests Created

- [x] Test: Super admin can access route
- [x] Test: Non-super admin sees access denied
- [x] Test: Unauthenticated users redirected to login
- [x] All tests passing (3/3)

### Build & Compilation Checks

- [x] Frontend builds successfully (`npm run build`)
- [x] No TypeScript errors (`tsc --noEmit`)
- [x] No console errors during build
- [x] Route properly code-split for lazy loading

### Route Configuration Verified

```typescript
Path: /admin/feature-management
Protection: super_admin role required
Layout: AppLayout (with Navbar + Sidebar)
Loading: LazyWrapper with PageSkeleton
Component: FeatureManagement page
```

### Access Control Matrix

| User Type | Authentication | Authorization | Result |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|---------|
| Unauthenticated | ❌ No | N/A | Redirect to /login |
| Authenticated (pharmacist) | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | Access Denied page |
| Authenticated (owner) | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | Access Denied page |
| Authenticated (super_admin) | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | Full Access ✅ |

### Requirements Coverage

| Requirement | Status | Implementation |
|-------------|--------|----------------|
| 5.1 - Auth required | ✅ | ProtectedRoute component |
| 5.2 - super_admin role | ✅ | requiredRole="super_admin" |
| 5.3 - 401 for unauth | ✅ | Redirect to /login |
| 5.4 - 403 for non-admin | ✅ | Access Denied page |
| 5.5 - Auth failure redirect | ✅ | Navigate to /login |
| 5.6 - Access denied message | ✅ | AccessDenied component |
| 5.7 - Super admin access | ✅ | Full page access |
| 5.8 - Validate per request | ✅ | ProtectedRoute checks |
| 5.9 - Session expiration | ✅ | Auth context handles |
| 10.1-10.10 - Backward compat | ✅ | No existing routes affected |

### Integration Points

- [x] Uses existing `ProtectedRoute` component
- [x] Uses existing `AppLayout` component
- [x] Uses existing `LazyWrapper` component
- [x] Uses existing `PageSkeleton` component
- [x] Follows existing route patterns
- [x] Consistent with other admin routes

### Test Results

```
✓ Feature Management Route (3 tests) 96ms
  ✓ should render FeatureManagement page for super_admin users 35ms
  ✓ should show access denied for non-super_admin users 49ms
  ✓ should redirect unauthenticated users to login 10ms

Test Files  1 passed (1)
     Tests  3 passed (3)
```
