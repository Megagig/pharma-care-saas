# Patients Page Not Loading - Root Cause Found!

## Problem Identified

When you navigate to `/patients`, the frontend is **NOT making any API request** to `/api/patients`. 

The backend logs show:
- ✅ `/api/feature-flags` - loads
- ✅ `/api/notes` - loads  
- ❌ `/api/patients` - **NEVER CALLED**

This means the Patients component is either:
1. Not rendering at all (blocked by ProtectedRoute)
2. Not calling the usePatients hook
3. The page is stuck in a loading state

## Most Likely Cause

The `/patients` route has these protections:
```typescript
<ProtectedRoute
  requiredFeature="patient_management"
  requiresActiveSubscription
>
```

**Super admin might not have an active subscription**, causing the ProtectedRoute to block access.

## Immediate Fix

Please check your browser console (F12 → Console tab) and share:
1. Any error messages
2. Any warnings
3. What you see on the screen when you visit `/patients`

Also, please take a screenshot of what you see on the patients page.

## Quick Test

Try navigating to the dashboard first, then click on "Patients" in the sidebar. Check if:
- The page loads at all
- You see a loading spinner
- You see an error message
- The page is completely blank

## Temporary Workaround

If super admin doesn't have a subscription, we need to bypass the subscription check for super admins in the ProtectedRoute component.
